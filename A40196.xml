            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:96882:4"/> biting one another, and killing one another, which things were not in the Churches of Chriſt, and we have a great controverſie with you, and that from the Lord; we have tried you, ſearched you, and diſovered your foundation, and its not found, nor will not ſtand in the triall; we have fetcht your Line from the firſt original, and we have found out your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and we find yours of that Race, which Chriſt propheſied of that ſhould come, which ſhould deceive many, having the ſheeps cloathing, but inwardly ravening, and which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw was come, and went out from the Apoſtles, and true Churches, which went from the truth, and went into the world, and had the forme of godlineſſe without the power; here began the Race in the Apoſtacie of the Churches, and when they Apoſtatized from the true faith, then came your original up, and the world went after them, and all that dwelt upon the earth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped the beaſt, that hath reigned through all this time of Apoſtacie, which hath been ſince the daies of the Apoſtles; and we find your origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal goe no further then to the falſe bretheren, and falſe Apoſtles, which went out from the true Apoſtles, and run for gifts and rewards, and preached for filthie lucre, and through covetouſneſſe made mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of ſouls, ſeeking monie and gain to themſelves; I ſay we find your Original begins there, and your Line goes no further, and never came your firſt riſe ſo far as the true Apoſtles, you were not in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their life nor birth, nor cannot be reckoned from their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, for you ſucceed not them; but you truely ſucceed the falſe Apoſtles, and falſ bretheren, which Chriſt propheſied ſhould come after his daies, &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw was come, and coming in his daies; and we find you of this ſtock and generation, and now you are diſcovered to be contrarie to the true Apoſtles, and agreeing with the falſe Apoſtles, in call, in practice, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intenance, and in all things; and the Line of true judgement is laid upon you all, and you are meaſured, and found too ſhort, and weighed and found too light, and we wil deale truely with you in judgement; firſt we do hold controverſie with you as concerning your call, your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, it agreeth not with, but is contrarie to what the Apoſtles call was; they were called by power from on high, and were made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by the gift of the holy ſpirit received from God, and their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie was an abſolute gift from God, and not to be bought and ſold for monie, and they were anointed of the Father, by his ſpirit of promiſe, and to preach the Goſpel; but your call is at ſchools, and Colledges, in ſuch, and ſuch orders, which are attained through naturall induſterie, ſuch, and ſuch arts, and ſciences, and degrees, having been ſo many years brought up in ſtudying naturall arts and naturall Languages, this is your ordination and your call, having no reſpect to receive, or to wait for the gift of the holy ſpirit to be made Miniſters thereby, and this is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Apoſtles and true miniſters, and equall and according to the falſe prophets and deceivers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Againe you are not according, but contrary to the true miniſtry and Miniſters of Chriſt in practiſe; for they were led by the ſpirit of the Father which dwelt in them, and they preached the Goſpel
<pb facs="tcp:96882:4"/> by the ſpirit, and ſpake as the ſpirit gave them utterance, and went up and down the world through Nations, converting people to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, and what they had handled, taſted, ſeen, and felt of the word of life in them, that they declared to others, and preached the Goſpell, which they had not received from man, nor by man, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt in them; But your practiſe is not ſuch, but contrary, for the ſpirit of this world leads you, and it you follow in all your works, in your preaching, praying, and in your whole worſhip, in forme and tradition, what you have ſtudied for, out of books and old Authors, you preach to people, and what ye have noted in a book, that you preach by an hour-glaſſe, and not as the ſpirit of God gives you ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance; and you ſeek out and enquire after great benefits, and much money by the yeare, and where there is much Tithes and Gleab-lands, and ſuch like, thither and to ſuch a place you goe, and ſeeke after, to be Miniſters there, and there you remain 20. 40. more or fewer yeares as you can agree with the people, and while they will give you ſo much as will content you, and maintain you, your wives, and families as you ſay, &amp; reſpect not whether any be converted to God by your preaching, but people remaines alwaies in blindneſſe and ignorance generally, and without the knowledge of God; for you preach other mens words, and what you have collected in your imaginations from the Saints words an hour by a glaſſe, leaning upon a ſoft cuſhion, and for money and and hire, preaching to the people, and this is your manner of practiſe, and Miniſtery, in theſe Nations, but thus did not the Apoſtles, nor Chriſts Miniſters; but the contrary; and by your fruits and works it appeares that you are not followers of that ſpirit that Chriſt and his Miniſters were guided by, neither are lawfull ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, but by your fruits and practiſe you manifeſt that the Lord never ſent you, nor Chriſt never called you into his ſervice to be his Miniſters, for in all your practiſes and in your whole performances of worſhip you differ, and doth not agree, but are contrarie to what the practiſe and worſhip of Chriſts Miniſters, and Churches were in the daies of the Apoſtles; this I charge upon you, in the Name, and by the Authoritie of the Lord God, and am able to prove it againſt you, face to face, or otherwiſe to ſhew that you are not of the ſame ſpirit, but contrary to the Saints and Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of old, and ſo not true ſucceeders of them, nor lawfull Miniſters of Chriſt, as to all people it is, and ſhall be made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You diſagree and are contrarie altogether to the true mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, and to the Apoſtles, in reſpect of your maintenance and wages, for the wages which Chriſt allowed his Miniſters, was, into whatſoever houſe they entered, that was worthy, they might eate ſuch things as are ſet before them, for the workeman (ſaith he) is worthy of his hire, and the Apoſtles eat onlie of the fruit of the vineyard that they had planted, and of the milk of the flock which they kept; by a free gift of the people, which they had begotten to the faith, and to whom they ſowed ſpirituall things; it was but as a ſmall matter if they reaped their carnall things, yet as a free gift they would doe it, and the Apoſtle ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:96882:5"/> he would not make the Goſpel of Chriſt chargeable; And in this manner were Chriſts Miniſters and Miniſtrie in wages and gifts, upheld and maintained outwardly in the world.</p>
            <p>But your practiſe and maintenance is not ſuch, but contrary, as is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie made manifeſt, for you will have ſo much by the Yeare promiſed to you in Tythes, money, or Gleab-lands, or ſtipends, and of drunkards, and ſwearers, and prophane wordly people, who are not ſheep of Chriſts flock, nor plants of his vine-yard, you will have ſo much of each of them, and of every man, in ſuch a compaſſe as you call your pariſh, and if any either out of covetouſneſſe or good conſcience, cannot pay you, you ſue at Law, and caſt into priſon, for wages, and ſpoile their goods, and take treble, nay ſome times 5. double damage, and through violence and injuſtice, and cruelty are you maintained in ſuch a manner, and not as the true Miniſters and Apoſtles of Chriſt were, but in a way and manner quite contrarie as it is manifeſt, and ſo herein it is proved, that you are not lawfull ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Againe you follow not the Apoſtles, and true Miniſters of Chriſt, but are contrarie to them in doctrine, as this following vollume will clearly manifeſt, which for this very end is collected from your own mouths and pens, that all men may ſee what you are, and what you hold and profeſſe, and being truely laid down, and anſwered, let your ſelves, and all ſober men compare your doctrines and ſayings with the doctrines of the Apoſtles, and they may ſee you agree not with them, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them; and now friends to all you that profeſſe your ſelves to be Miniſters of the Goſpell, I do hereby declare unto you, in the name and authority of the Lord, that we have controverſie with you, and a great charge againſt you in all theſe things, in your call, in your practice, and in your maintenance, and in your doctrines, and our mouthes hath the Lord opened, and they cannot be ſhut, from declaring and crying againſt you, as ſuch whom the Lord never ſent, but are contrary to Chriſt, his prophets, and Apoſtles in all your waies, and practices, and the hand of the Lord is certainly againſt you, and his power and dread wil come over you, and lie upon your conſciences.</p>
            <p>Now Reader, whoſoever thou art that reades this following volume if thy mind be ſober, and thy heart right towards God, thou may come to a good underſtanding of the ground and cauſe of this great contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, between the Prieſts and the profeſſors of this Nation, and us, who are in ſcorne called Quakers, for it is not unknown to Nations, of this great debate and battel, now for ſome yeares of continuance in this Nation, no man can be ignorant, what putting in priſons, and what perſecuting, and what preaching, and printing againſt us, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and ſame hath been through this Nation for ſome yeares paſt; and the Quakers ſo called, have written, and ſpoken, and printed, againſt the Prieſts and their worſhips, and waies, and doctrines, and declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as deceivers and falſe prophets, and ſuch as never were ſent of God; &amp; on the other hand, thus have the Prieſts, and more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie cried out againſt, and printed againſt the Quakers as hereticks, and
<pb facs="tcp:96882:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> deceivers, and witches, and all what they could ſay thats evil, and theſe things being not unknown, but publiklie brought to paſſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be good to diſcover unto every man, the firſt ground and cauſe of this great ſtrife, and the matter of it, and its beginning, ſo that all may know the certaintie of theſe things, and know they are not without good ground, and ſufficient reaſon on our part, to wit, that we have juſt cauſe to do, and ſtrive againſt that generation of <hi>Prieſts and Teachers,</hi> and that we doe nothing raſhly, and without ſufficient <hi>reaſon.</hi> It is now about ſeaven years ſince the Lord raiſed us up in the North of <hi>England</hi> and opened our mouthes in this his ſpirit; and what we were before in our Religion, profeſſion, and practices is well known to that part of the countrie, how generalie we were men of the ſtricteſt ſect, and of the greateſt zeal in the performance of outward righteouſneſſe, and went through and tried all ſorts, of Teachers, and run from mountain to mountaine, and from man to man, and from one forme to an other, as doe many to this very day, who yet remaines ungathered to the Lord, and ſuch we were, (to ſay no more of us) that ſought the Lord, and deſired the knowledge of his waies more then any thing beſide, and for one I may ſpeak, who from a child, even a few yeares old, he ſet his face to ſeek and find the Saviour, and more then Life and treaſure, or any mortal Crown ſought after with all his heart, the one thing that is needfull, to wit, the knowledge of God: And after our long ſeeking, the Lord appeared to us, and revealed his glory in us, and gave us of his ſpirit from heaven, and poured it upon us, and gave us of his wiſdome to guid us, whereby we ſaw all the world, and the true ſtate of all things and the true condition of the Church in her preſent eſtate; firſt the Lord brought us by his power, and wiſdome, and the word by which all things were made to know and underſtand, &amp; ſee perfectly that God had given to us, everie one of us in particular, a Light from himſelfe ſhining in our harts &amp; conſciences, which Light, Chriſt his Son, the Saviour, of the world had lighted every man, and all mankind withall; which Light in us we found ſufficient to reprove us, and convince us of every evil deed, word and thought, and by it, in us, we come to know good from evil, right from wrong, and whatſoever is of God, and according to him, from what is of the Devil, and what is contrary to God in motion, word and work; and this Light gave us to diſcerne between truth and error, between e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very falſe and right way, &amp; it perfectlie diſcovered to us the true ſtate of all things, and we thereby came to know man, what he was in his creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before tranſgreſſion, &amp; how he was deceived &amp; overcome by the devil; &amp; his eſtate in tranſgreſſion, &amp; in diſobedience, &amp; how he is drove &amp; baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the preſence of the Lord, and the ſorrow and anguiſh which he is in, &amp; to undergo; &amp; alſo by the Light in us, we perfectlie came to know the way of Reſtauration, and the meanes to be reſtored; and the ſtate of man being come out of tranſgreſſion and reſtored, theſe things to us were revealed by the Light within us, which Chriſt had given us, and lightened us withall, what man was before tranſgreſſion, and what he is in tranſgreſſion, and what he is being redeemed out of tranſgreſſion,
<pb facs="tcp:96882:6"/> and alſo the Light which ſhined in every one of us, as to it our mindes became turned, and our hearts inclined, the perfect eſtate of the Church we came to know; her eſtate before the Apoſtles daies, and in the Apoſtles daies, and ſince the daies of the Apoſtles, and her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate we found to be as a woman who had once been cloathed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet, who brought forth him that was to Rule the Nations; but ſhe was fled in the Wilderneſſe, and there ſitting deſolate, in her place, that was prepared of God for ſuch a ſeaſon, which ſeaſon in the very end thereof, when the time of her ſojorning, was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a full end, then were we brought forth, if any have an eare they may hear, ſo that all theſe things concerning man, and concerning the times and ſeaſons, and the changing and renewing of times, and all things that pertaines to ſalvation, and Redemption and eternal Life, needfull for man to know, all this was revealed, diſcovered, and made knowne to us, by the Light which was in us, which Chriſt had ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us withall.</p>
            <p>And we found this Light to be a ſufficient teacher, to lead us to Chriſt, from whence this Light came, and thereby it gave us to receive Chriſt, and to witneſſe him to dwel in us, and through it the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant we came to enter into, to be made heires of life and ſalvation, and in all things we found the Light which we were inlightned withall, and all mankind (which is Chriſt) to be alone and onelie ſufficient to bring to Life and eternal ſalvation, and that all who did own the Light in them which Chriſt hath enlightened every man withall, they needed no man to teach them, but the Lord was their Teacher, by his Light in their own conſciences, and they received the holie anointing.</p>
            <p>And ſo we ceaſed from the teachings of all men, and their words, and their worſhips, and their Temples, and all their baptiſmes, and Churches, and we ceaſed from our own words, and profeſſions, and practiſes in Religion, in times before zealouſly performed by us, through divers formes, and we became fooles for Chriſts ſake, that we might become truelie wiſe; and by this Light of Chriſt in us were we led out of all falſe waies and falſe preachings, and falſe Miniſters, and we met together often, and waited upon the Lord in pure ſilence, from our own words, and all mens words, and hearkned to the voice of the Lord, and felt his word in our hearts, to burn up and beat down all that was contrary to God, and we obeyed the Light of Chriſt in us, and followed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Lords pure ſpirit, and took up the Croſſe to all earthly glories, Crowns, and waies, &amp; denied our ſelves, our relations, and all that ſtood in the way betwixt us and the Lord, and we choſe to ſuffer with and for the Name of Chriſt, rather then all the pleaſures upon earth, or all our former zealous profeſſions and practices in Religion without the power and ſpirit of God, which the world yet lives in. And while wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the Lord in ſilence, as often we did for many hours together, with our mindes and hearts toward him, being ſtayed in the Light of Chriſt within us, from all thoughts, fleſhly motions, and deſires, in our diligent waiting and feare of his Name, and hearkning to his word, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb facs="tcp:96882:6"/> often the pouring down of the ſpirit upon us, and the gift of Gods holy eternal Spirit as in the dayes of old, and our hearts were made glad, and our tongues looſed, and our mouths opened, and we ſpake with new tongues, as the Lord gave us utterance, and as his ſpirit led us, which was poured down upon us, on Sons and Daughters, and to us hereby was the deep things of God revealed, and things unutterable was known and made manifeſt; and the glory of the Father was revealed, and then began we to ſing praiſes to the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and to the Lamb for ever, who had redeemed us to God; and brought us out of the captivity and bondage of the world, and put an end to ſin and death, and all this was by and through, and in the light of Chriſt within us, and much more might be declared hereof, that which could not be believed if it were ſpoken, of the ſeveral and particular operations, and manifeſtations of the everlaſting ſpirit that was given us, and revealed in us; but this is the ſum; life and immortality was brought to light, power from on high and wiſdom was made manifeſt, and the day everlaſting appeared unto us, and the joyful Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs did ariſe and ſhine forth unto us and in us; and the holy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting, the everlaſting Comforter, we received; and the Babe of glory was born; and the heir of the promiſe brought forth, to Reign over the earth, and over Hell and death, whereby we entered into everlaſting union, and fellowſhip and Covenant with the Lord God, whoſe mercies are ſure and infinite, and his promiſe never fales; and much might be ſpoken, but this is the ſum, we were raiſed from death to life, and are changed from Satans power to God, and gathered from all the dumb Shepherds, and off all the barren mountains, into the fold of Eternal Peace and reſt, and mighty and wonderful things hath the Lord wrought for us, and by us, by his own outſtretched Army.</p>
            <p>And thus we became followers of the Lamb whither ſoever he goes, and he hath called us to make War in righteouſnes for his names ſake againſt Hell and death, and all the powers of darkneſs; and againſt the beaſt and falſe Prophet, which hath deceived the Nations; and we are of the Royal ſeed elect, choſen and faithful, and we War in truth, and juſt judgement, not with weapons that are carnal; but by the ſword that goes out of his mouth, which ſhall ſlay the wicked, and cut them them to pieces; and after this manner was our birth, and bringing forth, and thus hath the Lord choſen us and made us as an Army dreadful and terrible before whom the wicked do fear and tremble; and our ſtandard is truth, juſtice, righteouſneſs, and equity; and all that comes unto us, muſt cleave thereunto, and fight under that banner without fear, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting, and they ſhall never be aſhamed nor put to flight, neither ſhall ever they be conquered by Hell or death or by the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but the Lord ſhall be their armour, weapon and defence for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and they that follow the Lamb ſhall overcome, and get the victory over the beaſt, and over the Dragon, and over the gates of Hell; for the Lord is with us, and who ſhall be able to make us afraid?</p>
            <p>Then having thus armed us with power, ſtrength and wiſdom, and
<pb facs="tcp:96882:7"/> Dominion, according to his mind, and we having learned of him, and being taught of him in all things, and he having choſen us into his work, and put his ſword into our hand, and given us perfect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to go forth in his Name and Authority, having the word from his mouth what to cut down and what to preſerve, and having the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel to Preach to the inhabitants of the earth, and being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in ſpirit to leave all, and follow him, and go forth in his work, yea an abſolute neceſſity was laid upon us, and wo unto us if we Preached not the Goſpel, for when we looked abroad and beheld the world, behold it was altogether darkneſs, and even as a wilderneſs, and deſolate, and barren of good fruit; and death reigned over men, and no good fruit was brought forth to God, but leaves we beheld upon every ſoul; and all men and peoples were made drunk with the wine of whoredoms, and the Whores cup they had drunk, and was committing fornication with the great Whore, and ſhe reigned over the Kings and peoples of the earth; and the Antichriſt was ſet up in the Temple of God, ruling over all, and having brought Nations under his power, and ſet up his Government over all for many ages, even ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles and true Churches hath he reigned, while the woman hath been fled into the wilderneſs, and the man child caught up to God; Chriſt ſaid Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhould come, and put on the ſheepes cloathing, and be inwardly a ravening Wolfe, and <hi>John</hi> ſaw that Antichriſt was come in his dayes, and he went forth then from the true Church, and went into the world, and deceived the world; and ever ſince his Kingdom hath reigned over Nations, for then he begun to exalt himſelf, and it is ſixteen hundred years ſince; all which time Antichriſt that hath had the ſheepes cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but inwardly a ravener, and hath ruled and reigned; and this we ſaw and perceived, in the very time of our birth and bringing forth; and we beheld Nations as a wilderneſs untilled, and mens hearts as the fallow ground unbroken up, and not plowed nor ſown with the good ſeed of Gods Kingdom; ſo that we ſaw all ſtates and orders of men corrupted and degenerated from what they ought to be, and from what God had once ordained them: As for the Miniſtry firſt, we look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it with a ſingle eye, in the light of the Spirit of God which had annointed us, we beheld it clearly (which formerly we had been ſtumbling at and much doubting of, that it was not the perfect Miniſtry of Chriſt for many years before) not to be of Chriſt nor ſent of him, nor having the Commiſſion power and Authority of Chriſt as his Miniſtry had in the dayes of the true Churches, but in all things, as in Call, practice, maintenance, and in every thing elſe in fruits and effects, we found it diſagree, and be wholly contrary to the true Minſtry of Chriſt in the dayes of the Apoſtles, and likewiſe we truely beheld it to be in Call, practice, and maintenance, and all things the very ſame in fruits and effects; with the falſe Miniſtry and falſe Prophets, and falſe Apoſtles, and deceivers of old; and this I do teſtifie, and am able to prove in the ſpirit and Authority of the Lord, that the publike Miniſtry as now it ſtands generally, is wholly degenerated from what the true Miniſtry of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:96882:7"/> once was, and differeth and is contrary in all things to what Chriſts Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were, and agreeth, and is equal in all things with what the falſe prophets and deceivers were throughout all ages; and this I charge upon it, in the face and view of all men to whom this may come; for this we ſaw concerning it, in the beginning, and our firſt aſſurance. And as for other places and orders of men and callings we ſaw them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo corrupted and degenerated, and evil and iniquity abounding among all ſorts of people, and blindneſs and darkneſs covered the face of the earth and of the world, and all people were in their tranſgreſſions, and making void the Law of God, and that it was time for the Lord to work, and to ariſe to eaſe himſelf of his adverſaries; and as for all Churches (ſo called) and profeſſions and gatherings of people, we beheld you as all in the Apoſtacy and degeneration from the true Church, nor being gathered by the ſpirit of the Lord, nor anoynted thereby, as the true members of Chriſt ever were, but to be in a form, and in forms of righteouſneſs without the power, and in Immitations without life, and perfect knowledge; ſo that all the practices of Religion we beheld with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power, and life, though ſome had a ſencerity in them, and a zeal and a deſire towards the Lord, yet all people erred in Judgement and none were guided in Judgement by the Eternal ſpirit, and becauſe of the error in Judgement that made their zeal blind, and their performances of righteouſneſs not accepted, though acted in ſome ſincerity and zeal, becauſe they were not guided in practice, and led in Judgement by the ſpirit of the Lord, which onely leads into all truth, and none are in the truth but are who led onely thereby, ſo that we beheld all profeſſion, but as coverings with figg leaves, while the nature of tranſgreſſion ſtood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned, &amp; not crucified. Alſo then we ſaw not only the performance and practice in Church ſtate, and in Religious orders were corrupted, but alſo Goverment, and Magiſtracy, and all things in civil ſtate were not aright in the ſight of the Lord, nor as the Lord required, neither as he had ordained in the beginning; for Government we know as ordained of God, is to puniſh, and limit and terifie, all evil doers, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and defend all that do well; and that mens conſciences are to be left free, to be ruled by the Lord alone, and guided by his ſpirit, and that outward power and civil Magiſtrates and Lawes (ſo called) ought not to be Lord or Ruler in mens conſciences, nor over them; but we beheld how unrighteouſneſs and iniquity, and ſin and wickedneſs was ſtrengthened, and encouraged in the Government, and by ſuch as were in Authority; and how the fear of God and the exerciſe of a good conſcience was abuſed; ſo that it was turned backward from what it ought to be; them that did well were puniſhed, and limited as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, and the evil doers were ſet free, and not made afraid, ſo, that we could truely cry, truth was fallen in the ſtreets, and juſtice and true Judgement turned backward, and equity had no place to enter, and the innocent was devoured through want of true and juſt Judgement, and the needy was ſpoiled and made a prey, and thus it was framed, for no ſooner had we opened our mouthes, but the Magiſtrates begun to put
<pb facs="tcp:96882:8"/> us in priſon, and execute great injuſtice upon us, and became oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the innocent, and laid grievous unjuſt burdens upon us, grievous to be born, and true juſtice and judgement was neglected, and wrong judgement brought forth, and good Government abuſed, and men in authority not ruled by the Lord, neither ruling for the Lord among men, and thus it came to paſſe upon us, through the corruption and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in Government and Magiſtrates, which we ſaw to be, as it was fulfilled by them, to wit, not as the Lord required, nor as he in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ordained it, but quite the contrary, and this we ſaw in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, when the ſpirit of the Lord was poured down upon us, and power from on high was revealed to declare againſt all the the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth, and to make war againſt all corruption, in all orders, and places, and men.</p>

            <p>And in the beginning we were but few in number, onely a few that thus were carried on and dealt with all and that had received the power from on high in ſuch a meaſure, and for ſuch a work; and no ſooner did the Lord appear to us, and with us, but the Devil and his power roſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us to deſtroy us, and it wrought in Rulers, Prieſts, and people, and all the waies and meanes invented by the Devil that could be executed by his ſervants were brought forth, to quench the work of the Lord, and to ſtop our paſſage in what we were called to; did ye but perfectly know, as we perfectly found the craftineſſe and policie, and wickedneſſe of the Devil, how to overcome this new borne babe? and how to root out for ever this plant, that was newly ſprang forth? it would make you admire and wonder with admiration; all the prieſts and Rulers were in an uproar, the Prieſts they petitioned to the Magiſtrates, and run up &amp; down from one ſeſſions and Judicatory to another, &amp; took wicked oathes and ſlandered the juſt with lies and reproaches, on purpoſe to incenſe all people againſt us, and the Magiſtrates gave forth warrants for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending of ſome, and made their orders to break our meetings, and that we ſhould not meet in the night ſeaſon, and ſuch men might not paſſe abroad, and ſuch ſtirr and oppoſition vvas made againſt us, it can hardly be expreſſed or declared, there was uproars in ſteeple-houſes, and uproars in markets, and often haling before Magiſtrates, and abuſed, and threatned, and ſlandred, and all manner of evil done, and ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and great injuſtice, cruelty and oppreſſion acted againſt us,

            <p>And after this manner it came to paſſe concerning us, and much more might be ſaid, but this is in ſhort declared how we were intreated, and dealt withall by Prieſts, Rulers, and People, through all the Northern counties of <hi>England</hi> in our firſt going forth, through which counties we firſt Journied out of <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> through <hi>Cumberland, Northumberland</hi> and into ſome parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Durham, York-ſhire, Lancaſhire, Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> &amp;c. and in all theſe counties much oppoſition we had, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufferings, and cruell dealings from men of all ſorts, every Goal may witneſſe, in every county, how any of them ſeldome were without ſome of us, or our friends impriſoned in them this ſix yeares, and ſcarce one ſteeple-houſe or market in all theſe counties, but may witneſſe what beating, what bruiſings, ſtrikings and halings, and abuſings, and perils we have ſuffered and ſuſtained, and not one prieſt in all thoſe counties can cleare himſelfe from hatred and malice, and from envying of us, and doeing miſchief in words, and works, or thoughts, or deſires againſt us, nor ſcarce one Juſtice nor any officer of the peace, can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed in all them counties from plotting and acting injuſtice upon us, and threating and enacting cruelty againſt us; And I call Heaven and Earth to record, and the Light in every mans conſcience, and do appeal to that in all ſorts and places of people, that by all ſorts of people we ſuffered evil, and unjuſt works and actions and words from them, and let the witneſſe of God in all mens conſciences in all the North, give teſtimony what dealings and cruelty we ſuffered, and how we have been dealt withall,

<pb facs="tcp:96882:11"/> your eyes, you may ſee it is thus; and have we charged them falſly, or have not we ſpoken the truth concerning them? we have ſaid they are falſe miniſters and deceivers, and not true Miniſters of Chriſt, and is it not ſo? let the light in your conſciences anſwer; we have ſaid they have run, and never was ſent, and that they have not profited the people at all; and is it not ſo? to the witneſs of God in you I do appeal, and let that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that we have ſpoken nothing but the truth; examine and try in all things that we have charged them with, and are they not guilty in all things that we have charged upon them? let the witneſs of God in you teſtifie to this; and what do you judge of them, are they not of that ſtock which Chriſt ſaid ſhould come, and ſhould be wolves in ſheepes cloathing, and ſhould deceive many, and which <hi>John</hi> ſaw was come in his dayes, and which the world went after, and the whole world run after them; are not they in the nature of wolves? devouring and tearing the Lambs of Chriſt? and do they not tear people by cauſing their bodies to be impriſoned and their goods to be ſpoiled? and do they not deceive many? and yet they have the ſheepes cloathing, the Saints words and their practices but inwardly are they not ravening? and doth not the world go after them, and hath not the world run after them for many ages; and is it not thus with them? And have they received the gift of the holy Ghoſt, or are they not made Miniſters by the will of man, and not by the will of God? do they not differ and are contrary in call, in practice, in maintenance, and in fruits and effects to the true Miniſters and true Apoſtles? and do they not agree, and are they not according to the falſe Prophets, and falſe Miniſters, and deceivers in their call, practice, maintenance, fruits and effects? ſearch the Scriptures, and lay them to that line and then let the witneſs in your conſciences judge and anſwer, and do not they prepare War againſt ſuch as doth not put into their mouths? and do not they feed with the fat, and cloath with the wool? do not they oppreſſe the Nation, and the Creation? and are not they ſuch whoſe Call, and practices and maintenance, and whole Miniſtry? hath a dependance upon Popery and doth it not all ſavour of Popery, and in the main and Principal parts thereof, were ordained by the Pope? this may be fully made manifeſt; And are not all Profeſſors, and Sects of people ſuch as have the form but are without the power of godlineſs? are not people ſtill covetous, and earthly minded, and given to the world, and proud and vain, even ſuch as profeſſe Religion, and to a ſeperated people? is not Profeſſors as covetous, and proud, as ſuch as doth not profeſſe? and are not they given to the world, and doth it not ſhew that they are unchanged nor tranſlated, but death Reigns among them? and is it not manifeſt that they have taken up the form, of the Apoſtles and Chriſts words and practices, and are without the life, and not guided by the ſpirit of Chriſt and the Apoſtles in their praying and Preaching? and are not your ſouls lean and ſtarved; to the witneſs of God in you all I ſpeak; which may teſtifie that many people have a ſhew of Religion without life, and therefore have not we ſpoken the truth of them, in what we

            <p>And alſo, upon ſuch an engagement we ſhould agree to have the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, freely, and ſoberly to object againſt the Prieſts, concerning their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, their call, their practice, their maintenance, and their fruits and effects, and concerning their Church, and principles, and worſhip, and whole Religion, and ſhall hear patiently all that can be ſaid in defence thereof by any or all of them, and ſhall prove by the ſpirit of the Lord, and according to the ſcriptures, that their miniſtry is not the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Chriſt, nor they true and lawfull Miniſters of the Goſpel, but ſhal manifeſt by evident arguments, that their call, practice, maintenance, fruites and effects, are not according nor agreeing, but contrary and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, to what the true Miniſtry was, and its call, practice, mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, fruites and effects were in the true Apoſtles, and among the true Churches, and furthermore by the Grace of God we ſhall prove their Church, their worſhip, and their whole Religion, in all parts thereof, to be degenerated from what the true Church was, and the true worſhip, and true Religion, in the daies of the Apoſtles, and true Churches of old, and theſe things ſhall we make manifeſt by faithfull and ſound arguments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſcriptures, that all the earth may know, and all people perceive who is in the truth, and of the true worſhip and Religion, and who are in the contrary, and whether the Prieſts, and that which they profeſſe and practice for Religion, or the Quakers, and that which they profeſſe and practice for Religion, be of God and according to him, and whether are contrary; that the end of this long travel, and war and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovercy

            <p>And let all the Prieſts and profeſſors lay aſide and give over their houſes of correction, and impriſoning people, and whipping of them, and ſtocking of us, and dealing in this manner of violence and cruelty, as for years by-paſt they have done in defence of their Religion, and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of ours, and let them lay aſide their carnall weapons, and fighting againſt our perſons, and impriſoning of us about our Religion, and let them come forth in ſound arguments, the beſt they have, and let us ſee what ſpiritual weapons they have to reſiſt us, and defend themſelves, &amp; let us try, whether their ſpiritual weapons or ours be the ſtrongeſt, and the moſt powerfull, and mighty, &amp; let theirs that are ſo, prevaile againſt the other, be it ours, or theirs, and this is the way to try the truth, and to make all things manifeſt, and to deſide and end all the whole contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies between us and them, which hath been great this many yeares, and let the truth be ſet up and exalted, where ever it is, and all deceit thrown down to the ground, and let us war with the weapons of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, againſt errour and falſe religion, one in the other, but lets not hurt creatures, nor impriſon perſons, nor ſtock and whip creatures, and make them to ſuffer, but let us threſh deceit, and whip and beat that, and all falſe opinions, let us throw them down, where they are found, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in them or in us, and let us fight with the weapons of the ſpirit, that are ſpiritual, &amp; let them ſight no longer with ſuch cruel carnal weapons, and then let ſuch as get the victory, and overcomes, appear to be in the truth of the Church, and ſuch as falls and is overcome, be manifeſt to be in the error, and of the falſe Church and Religion, and let us love one anothers perſons, and let them act no otherwiſe towards our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, then we do upon theirs, and towards them, and let them take the liberty to deal with us, and our perſons, as we deale with them, and their perſons, and no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And let ſuch, whether them or us, that cannot prove ourſelves to be the true Church of Chriſt, nor of the true worſhip, and true Religion, nor in the truth, but is found to be in the error, and out of the truth, let ſuch deny their worſhip and Church, and renounce all their Religion, and confeſſe to all the world, under their hands, that they are and have been deceived, and for ever hereafter ſtop their mouthes, and never profeſſe nor practice any more what they have done in ſuch Religion; And freely upon theſe Iſſues and conditions we will joine trial with them, let them appoint time, place, and profer terms at their own pleaſure, and then to all the world it ſhall be manifeſt, and to all people diſcovered, whether we have not good ground and ſufficient reaſon, to war againſt theſe Prieſts, and it may perfectly appear that what we have ſaid and written againſt them theſe divers yeares, have been upon a good foundation, and we have had ſufficient cauſe to ſpeak and write againſt them, as we have done, and none thenceforth ſhall have cauſe to ſay, or doubt, that what we have ſpoken and written againſt them hath been out of malice
<pb facs="tcp:96882:13"/> or envy, and without cauſe and good reaſon; but on the contrary all ſhall know the ground of quarrel is ſufficient and full of equity on our part.</p>
            <p>And upon theſe or any equal tearms and conditions, would we, and are we willing to engage with theſe Prieſts, and all, or any one of theſe Sects, in a lawful tryal, in diſputes, or writings, for the tryal and ſearching out of the truth, and the true Religion; And were it not equal &amp; reaſonable, that we had the ſame liberty among all theſe Prieſts, and in their Church and Aſſemblies freely to declare our minds, and to let forth our ſelves in what we hold and profeſs, without being violently haled, and beat, and whipped, and ſent to priſon, as we have been this many years; which liberty we do freely grant and allow among us to all, to query, or declare what is upon them, without ſuch violent dealing, or whipping, or ſending them to priſons and houſes of correction; and the ſame and no other do we deſire of others in this particular of freedom to declare the truth, and what we hold, then what we do and would allow to others; and that no weapon be uſed by them againſt us, nor dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, but the weapons of the ſpirit, the beſt they have, or can bring forth againſt us, and let them let creatures alone, and not hurt nor do violence to them, and no other weapons ſhall we uſe againſt them, nor deal with them by any other thing, but the weapons of the Spirit of God, which is powerful, and will bring down ſtrong holds; and as for creatures, we ſhall not hurt, nor do violence, nor impriſon them, and whoſe weapons are the ſtrongeſt, let ſuch overcome.</p>
            <p>And ſuch as are overcome, is not the true Church; for the true Church of Chriſt which is builded upon the Rock, the gates of hell cannot prevail againſt, and who doth overcome, with ſuch let it be manifeſt that God of a truth is with them; and let them all ceaſe to defend their Church and Miniſtry, and Religion with priſons, and whips, and houſes of correction, for by ſuch things was never the true Church, Miniſtry and Religion defended, but onely the power and Authority of God preſerved them, and reſiſted all their enemies; and ſo it is at this day; and let all ceaſe to cry deceivers, and being afraid to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for if they be the true Church, all, or any of theſe Sects and Profeſſions of Religions, then if we be deceivers, and come among them, they cannot be deceived, if they be in the election; for no deceivers, nor the gates of hell cannot prevail againſt the true Church of Chriſt, nor againſt them that are elect, which the Devil hath nothing in; And if we be the true Church of Chriſt, and in the election, then if all the deceivers upon earth come among us, they cannot prevail againſt us, nor deceive us; for the elect cannot be deceived; and upon theſe tearms, we may engage with any people and Sect upon earth, therefore come to this, and joyn with us, take you the liberty to declare in ſoberneſs what you own and profeſs, &amp; you ſhall not be perſecuted, nor your bodies nor perſons harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by violence; and let us have that liberty to deelare in meekneſs and ſoberneſs, and in Gods Authority, amongſt you what we hold and profeſſe, and let us not be perſecuted, and dealt violently withall; and
<pb facs="tcp:96882:13"/> then let it appear whether we or our enemies hath a greater teſtimony, and more powerful in the hearts of people. And were not this a way full of equity for the tryal of all things? But doing contrary as you have done theſe many years againſt us, by violence and whipping, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, it ſhewes you have not the ſpirituall weapons, nor the Authority of God with you, nor among you, and that is the cauſe of running to Magiſtrates, and putting in Goals, and whippings, and all violence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Authority of Gods ſpirit is wanting amongſt you, which all the falſe Sects and falſe Churches, ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, have wanted, to defend themſelves and reſiſt their enemies; and ſo all ſects have been fighting one with another, and killing perſons and creatures, and defended themſelves, by priſons, and inquiſitions, and deſtroying of lives; and all this have been out of the power of God, and not in it, but by the power of the Dragon, and of the Beaſt, who hath cauſed all to worſhip, and them that would not, he hath had power to kill, and hath killed them, by fires, and tortures, and cruel deaths, and all theſe have loſt the ſpiritual weapons, and been without the power and Spirit of God; And what a Church is this of yours which hath need to be defended by Goals, and priſons, and whips and ſtocks, and violent dealing? this Church is not the Church of Chriſt, for the power and Spirit of God defends her alwayes, and not inquiſitions, and priſons and whips, theſe are <hi>Cains</hi> weapons, and not the weapons of the Spirit of God, whereby his true Church was ever defended; for becauſe <hi>Cains</hi> ſacrifice was not accepted, therefore he ſlew his Brother, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted him; and thus you that are of <hi>Cains</hi> ſeed do the ſame, upon the ſame ground, becauſe your works are rejected and theirs accepted, with which you deal thus; in this violent way of perſecution and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>And this is the proteſtant Church (ſo called) and her Miniſters, with whom I am now dealing, which ſeems to be the true Church, and more then the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for you Proteſtant Miniſters do deny and cry againſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as a falſe Church, and her Miniſters to be deceivers (which in it ſelfe is very true) But yet your hypocriſie in this doth appear, and your double-mindedneſſe; for let me tell you while you cry againſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as a falſe Idolater, and a perſecutor of the true Church, and againſt her Miniſters to be deceivers, and contrary to the Apoſtles, are not your ſpirits the ſame, and your works the ſame in nature (though not in meaſure) and in particular, this work of yours to impriſon people, and whip them, and put them in the ſtocks, and beat them, and abuſe their perſons and bodies, who doth but ſpeak againſt you and your Religion? is not this worke of the very ſame nature as the work of the Romiſh Church? ſhe to defend her Church hath Inquiſitions, and baniſhment, and many cruel tortures, &amp; with theſe things her Church ſhe defends, killing and afflicting of peoples bodies, that doth oppoſe her Church and deny their Religion, and you have ſtocks, and whips, and houſes of correction, and putting great fines and taskes upon people, and baniſhing people out of townes, and ſpoiling their goods and caſting men
<pb facs="tcp:96882:14"/> into Priſon who doth oppoſe your Church, and deny your Religion, and is not this equal and juſtly according (in Nature) to the perſecution that is in the Romiſh Church? and what difference between the defence of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and your Church of Proteſtants? they have their inquiſitions, and you have your houſes of correction; they have their ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in the gallies, and you have whips, and ſtocks; they have their divers torments, and cruel dealings towards perſons that oppoſe them, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their bodies in one manner, and you have your torments and cruel dealings towards us in an other manner, though not in the ſame meaſure, yet in the ſame nature; and what difference between you and them? And herein doth the hypocriſie of the Proteſtant Church and their Miniſters appear, in that they cry againſt and denies the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and their perſecution and cruelty acted againſt others, and yet in nature and manner doth practice the very ſame upon us, as in <hi>England</hi> this day is witneſſed; And not onely in this particular may the Church, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Proteſtants be condemned for hypocriſie, but alſo in many other things, even the moſt of their practices in their worſhip is of the ſame nature, and by the ſame ſpirit, which the practices of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is practiſed by and in; and not onely ſo, but it may be truly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and made manifeſt, that the original and inſtitution of many of your Church practices proceeded from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church &amp; Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> did ordain &amp; inſtitute many of your practices, &amp; great a part of your worſhip, which is performed in the church &amp; by the Miniſtry of the Proteſtants (ſo called) &amp; this in its time &amp; ſeaſon I may make fully appear, and diſcover to the Nations, and I may ſhew in the particulars, what particulars of the worſhip &amp; practice in the Proteſtants Church had their firſt rice and beginning and originall in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though they are minced and degreſſed with diminiſhings &amp; addings, according as their imaginations have guided them, yet ſtill they retaine the ſtrongeſt taſte and ſavour of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had their rice and original there, though in the performing thereof, they may be altered and changed in appearance and form, but are perfectly the ſame in ground and Nature, as ſpringing from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhee the mother of the Proteſtant Church, and of the practices of the moſt of her performances in worſhip, and this may be proved, as God willing upon occaſion, as the Lord moves, I may let forth my mind, and what I know in theſe things, and may ſhew though that the Church of the Proteſtants have diſſerted the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet their Miniſtrie, its Call, and ordination, and its practice, and maintenance, hath a dependancy upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as being the original of that which is by them therein practiſed, though in ſome things deviated from the perfect form and practice thereof; And alſo the whole worſhip of all the particulars in relation to the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church, and Miniſtrie, and worſhip, hath a dependance upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as being the firſt original thereof, and though they cry againſt her and her Miniſters, and have denied her, yet is ſhe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and wombe in which was bred, and out of whom proceeded the Proteſtant Church, Miniſtry, and worſhip, and practices, and this may
<pb facs="tcp:96882:14"/> be manifeſt at full that the Proteſtants Church, Miniſtry, and worſhip, chiefly taſteth and ſavoureth of the Church and worſhip of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had their original out of her; And alſo further may be ſhewed, that the Proteſtant Church, and worſhips and Miniſtry, are not an other in nature and being, then the Romiſh Church, Miniſtry, and worſhip, but is ſprung out thereof as a branch out of the ſame root, the ground being one and the ſame though differing in appearance; for in her beginning and firſt diſſenting from the Romiſh Church, ſhe did not deny her in ground and being, as not being at all the Church of Chriſt, but onely in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars deſſented alwayes then, &amp; to this day retayning divers of their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in worſhip and Church government, which doth ſhew, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church is not perfectly another, nor her Miniſtry, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and worſhip another then is the Romiſh Church; but is the ſame in ground and being, onely digreſſed and deviated in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; and this may be fully manifeſt in ſeaſon, that the proteſtant Church, &amp; worſhip, &amp; Miniſtry, is of the Romiſh Church ſprung as a branch out of her, not contrary to her, and againſt her; and all theſe things is the Lord diſcovering and laying open that Nations and peoples may come to behold the mother, of harlots, that miſtery of Iniquity, and all her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and may ſee the ſtate and turning of times, and things, ever ſince the daies of the Apoſtles, and true Churches, and how that all theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſects, and all theſe Churches, falſely ſo called, are riſen up and ſprung out one of another, and coming from one ſeed and wombe, and though divers in appearances, and ſundry in practices, and profeſſions, yet are they all one in the ground and nature, ſprung from the mother of harlots, all of them, and being her children, and ſhe hath corrupted the Earth with her Fornications and Whoredomes, and made Nations and Kingdomes drunk with her cup of idolatry; But the Lord God is riſen and will plead with her, and give her double, and the holy Prophets &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſhal rejoyce over her, &amp; this is coming to paſſe, and this have I ſeen from the Lord, &amp; received it from him, &amp; thus it came upon me to write.</p>

               <l>And the man-childe muſt come to rule, for ever throw gen'rations;</l>
               <l>And when this is all come to paſs, O then rejoyce and ſing,</l>
               <l>Ye Prophets and Apoſtles all, and heavenly children,</l>
               <l>When God hath you avenged, upon your enemies all,</l>

                  <hi>Samuel Eaton</hi> (who calls himſelfe a Teacher of the Church of Chriſt at <hi>Stockeport</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire</hi>) In his Book called, <hi>THE Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>AKERS Confuted, ſent to the Parliament,</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>AITH in his Epiſtle to the Parliament, then ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter, That they are not to judge of Saintſhip according to the large charity of ſome who are truly good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So here is another Doctrine then Chriſts was, who ſaid, <hi>The tree is known by its fruits, and by their fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi> And the fruits of the Spirit is known from the fruits of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Again, in the concluſion of his aforeſaid Epiſtle he begs a pardon of the Parliament, for the thoughts of his heart that he hath ſpread before them, and ſo puts them in the Popes place.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe in his Epiſtle to the Reader, becauſe <hi>Richard Waller</hi> witneſſeth his Teacher within, and bids others to minde the Light within them; and that he was come off of all other Teachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he judgeth this to be deluſion; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, who ſaith, <hi>Ye need no man to teach you, but as the ſame anointing doth teach you, which is truth, and is no lye,</hi> John 2.27. And again in Heb. 8. <hi>Ye ſhall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord, for they ſhall all know him from the least to the greateſt: for the Lord will write his law in their hearts, and put his ſpirit within them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Prin. He ſaith, <hi>he doth not believe that there is any ſubſtantiall, eſſentiall, or perſonall union betwixt the eternall Spirit and believers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although the Scripture ſaith, the ſpirit dwels in the <hi>Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. <hi>and he that is joyned to the Lord is one ſpirit,</hi> 1 John 1. As though the Saints had not union with God, which the ſcriptures ſaith they have.</p>
               <p>Prin. He ſaith, <hi>It is palpably falſe, and blaſphemy to ſay, that Saints know all things, and have power to work miracles to the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Contrary to the Miniſter of Chriſt, <hi>John,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>But yee have anoynting from the holy one, and know all things,</hi> 1 John 2.20. And Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Greater things then theſe ſhall yee do that believe in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prin. He ſaith, <hi>Though we believe that the ſpirit of Chriſt dwells in the Saints, yet we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the ſpirit of Chriſt to be diſtinct from the Saints,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> How are they led by the ſpirit, how are they led into all truth? And how are they ſanctified by the ſpirit, and their unity in the ſpirit? by which ſpirit they have unity with God; by which ſpirit the Saints worſhip him; And he <hi>that is joyned to the Lord is one ſpirit; He that hath not the ſpirit of Chriſt is none of his.</hi> And ſo they are diſtinct
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96882:18"/> from it; but they are not ſo that have it, and be in unity with it, and one with another with God.</p>
               <p>Prin. He ſaith, <hi>Although there be the ſame ſpirit in all the Saints that gave forth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, yet all Saints have not the ſame inſpiration of the ſpirit, that the Prophets and Apoſtles had, ſo as that they ſhould be able to give forth infallible truths, and immediately diſcover the pure and clear will of God, as the Prophets and Apoſtles did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this his Ignorance of the ſpirit, he hath ſhewed, and of the holy Ghoſt: And himſelf is the falſe ſpirit gone out into the world: For the ſpirit of truth ſhall lead into all truth, and bring to memory Chriſts words, and doth inſpire into them the things of God, and doth reveal to every one according to their meaſure.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>The Spirit doth not communicate according to the capacity in the creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Then there is none can divide the word aright; and God gives to every man as he will, and reproves the world, and leads the <hi>Saints</hi> into all truth.</p>
               <p>Prin. He ſaith, <hi>they had not known the ſignification of the words of Chriſt, but by the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſay, he, nor none knows the ſignification of Chriſts words, by the Evangeliſts words, but by the Evangeliſts ſpirit, and the ſame inſpiration which thou ſaiſt, thou looks not for.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>The Scriptures do give their own ſenſe, and is a ſtanding Rule,</hi> &amp;c. And yet thou ſaid a little before in <hi>page</hi> 4. <hi>They are darke, and are left to you to give a ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here then thou confoundeſt thy ſelfe; and the ſpirit of God is the ſtanding rule which leads them to ſpeak forth ſcripture, and not others words, and the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles words, did not lead to ſpeak forth ſcripture, but the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>They that have the anointing within them, had not an infallible judgement,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>They know all things;</hi> and bid them <hi>try the ſpirits,</hi> whether they were of God: And ſaid, they had the ſpirit of God, which ſpirit is infallible, and gives an infallible judgement, which ſpirit was to try the falſe Prophets that was gone out into the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr</hi> In ſome places thou ſaid, <hi>the Scriptures were dark, and hard to be underſtood;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And here thou ſaith, <hi>it is plain, and eaſily to be understood,</hi> page 8. Mark thy confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for the Scripture is not underſtood without the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>there is an infallible judgement, which may be made from the Scriptures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpirit,</hi> page 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Who can judge infallibly without the ſpirit? Chriſt told the Phariſees (who had the Scriptures) <hi>They were of the Devill,</hi> and judgement they had neglected, and he did not own their judgement to be infallible. And the Apoſtle ſaith, what they knew who are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the ſpirit, they knew naturally as bruit beaſts, <hi>Jude</hi> 10. &amp; 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hough they may ſpeak high words in hypocriſie. And there art thou with thy infallible judgement as thou ſaid, without the ſpirit (which is proved fallible) and there is no infallible judgement to be given that ſtands without the ſpirit; they that judges without the ſpirit, will judge amiſſe, and not infallible, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did of Chriſt, and as the naturall bruit beaſts did which <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of, there art thou.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> And he further ſaith there in the ſame page, <hi>That the Scripture is to be judge of the ſpirit, and a light ſufficient to judge of Doctrine and manners,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The <hi>Jewes</hi> had not infallible judgement that had Scriptures, but ſtood againſt Chriſt the Light, and judged him to be a Devill, that judgment was not infallible, and that doctrine and manners of theirs was not right; which ſtood againſt <hi>Chriſt the light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, the concluſion is, <hi>that the Scriptures is the foundation of an infallible judgment concerning things contained in them, and not the ſpirit,</hi> page 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So he hath thrown out God and Chriſt, and the ſpiritual man who was before the Scripture was, who was the cauſe of the giving them forth, and the inſpiring them through the Saints, which the Scripture ſaith, <hi>ſhall judge the world, yea Angels.</hi> And he may ſay upon this concluſion, that the world and the Devill hath the Judge, for they will get Scripture.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>He that can bridle his tongue is not a perfect man.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Chriſt within ſufficient for all things to teach them, and to make them perfect as he is, and as God is.</hi> Now ſaith he, <hi>ſuch an having of Chriſt as this is, we aſſume not, nor dare not aſſume: And we declare againſt it as a Satanicall deluſion, and the</hi> Quakers <hi>are the poor creatures that confeſſeth this in them,</hi> page 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And you that are not made perfect by Chriſt the truth, you remain out of truth, in the deluſion, and ſo you be out of the Apoſtles doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> The Paſtor ſaith, <hi>That ſuch a voyce as comes immediately from God we have not heard, and ſuch an immediate inſpiration as this from God we have not received, nor do we wait for it,</hi> page 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So ſhewing himſelfe to be of them that God never ſent: So you are as the <hi>Jewes</hi> that could ſay, <hi>Moſes heard the voyce of God,</hi> and the Prophets heard the Lords voyce. But their own eares ſtopt to the voyce. For Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Ye have not heard the voyce of God at any time.</hi> And ye ſay ye look not for it: and you that deny immediate inſpiration, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the powers and the ſpirit, for that's immediate, and the Miniſters of Chriſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>All that prayes by the ſpirit, and ſpeaks by the ſpirit, and doth not ſhew a miracle,</hi> theſe the Paſtor ſaith <hi>are Impoſtors,</hi> page 14.</p>
               <p>

So, he doth not know the Son that denies revelation, nor the Father, and denies themſelves to be any true Miniſters but by mans will, which is not immediate, which is the ſpirit, which miniſters of the ſpirit, and are immediate in the ſpirit, which thou art no.</p>
               <p>P. He ſaith, <hi>That there may be much fallacy and deluſion in Revelation.</hi>

For if they have but words that ſpeaks of the Saints faith, how they had their faith delivered from God; If that the Saints now have not their faith delivered to them from God, as they in ages paſt, they have but words: And as the Devil had, and ſtood againſt the author of the faith, Chriſt the light and the truth, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> had of the Saints, but out of their faith, and ſtands againſt them that be in it. And <hi>Timothy</hi> had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate teaching, for he had the teſtimony of the Lord, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> and thou ſaiſt he had not immediate teaching.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>there must not be waiting for an immediate word, but that word which hath been already to the Prophets and Apoſtles, which none have the word ſpoken as it was to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, they muſt have it immediately,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 17.</p>

And the Word is immediate, and all the Miniſters of Chriſt preach the immediate word, and wait for it, and the outward written words with inke and paper are mediate.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>but an overcoming of the body of ſin, ſuch as delivers from all ſin in this world is expreſly against the Scriptures, and made free from ſin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Contrary to the Apoſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> where he had put off the body of ſin. And contrary to Chriſt, who ſaves &amp; cleanſeth from all ſin by his blood, blots out all ſin: And <hi>if Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>He ſaith, that Chriſt is in heaven in his humanity, therefore not to be ſeen, not to be heard, not to be handled by us or any others that live upon earth, and they cannot give their own aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 19.</p>

               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>that the Saints doth not ſee Chriſt, for the heavens contain him,</hi> page 20.</p>

               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>the whole minde and will of Chriſt and God is left them in letters,</hi> page 21.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Which is contrary to the Apoſtle, who ſaith, <hi>As many as are the ſons of God, are led by the ſpirit of God.</hi> And Chriſt acts all in them, and for them; and the fruits of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>the ſpirituall man judgeth all things.</hi> And that is it which leads the Saints to devide and diſcern all things both temporall and ſpirituall, the ſpirituall wiſdome of God which gives them a ſpirituall underſtanding, which men muſt rule withall, but not with their own, that comes to nought; and you that have not that which is infallible to judge in you, know not the ſpirit of Chriſt, neither can you judge of perſons or things that have not the infallible judgement, nor have the ſpirituall man. Neither have you the word of God in your hearts, nor Chriſt which is eternall and infallible, all which the <hi>Quakers</hi> have to judge perſons and things.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>that children are of the ſeed as to the Church priviledges, and externall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of a ſpirituall nature.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Contrary to the Apoſtle, many have the form, but deny the power. The power preſerves the forme, ſees the end of forms, and deſtroys them, and brings to ſee before forms was, where forms is not. For the Apoſtles who lived in the power, denyed the <hi>Jewes</hi> forms, and <hi>Gentiles</hi> both, as we do now deny the Popiſh forms, and yours which you have invented and ſet up.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>And an immediate teaching</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>of the ſpirit, and to wait for ſecret inſpiration of God, is to ſubject men to ſatannicall deluſions, &amp;c.</hi> page 40.</p>

               <p>Pr. <hi>Are not they ſeduced (ſaith he) who are drawn off from the externall means by which the ſpirit is given, and faith wrought, to wait for the receiving of the ſpirit without any word to convey it to them? which ſpirit when they have it, is not the ſpirit of truth, but of deluſion, &amp;c.</hi> page 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſpirit and faith is not conveyed to any man, without the word, and they are ſeduced that reſts in the externall from the eternall, and the ſpirit is not given by external means, neither is faith wrought.</p>
               <p>Pr. And he ſaith, <hi>They need not any mans teaching them, but as the ſpirit in the Scriptures teaches, and they need not that any teachings of man ſhould be added.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And ſo by this he hath thrown out himſelf from being a Paſtor, and all other Paſtors and Teachers; and the ſpirit is not in the Scriptures, but in them that gave it forth. And the ſpirit which gave forth the Scriptures, which was in the Saints, opens the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures again, and leads into all truth.</p>
               <p>Pr. And he ſaith, <hi>there is an exceſſe in that Scripture which ſaith, Ye need no man teach you, but as the anointing teacheth you.</hi>

                  <hi>Pr.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>the Apoſtles ſayings to the Saints, And ye know all things,</hi> he calls it <hi>an exceſſive ſpeech, for no one knows all things but God,</hi> page 42.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So contrary to <hi>John,</hi> and would make him a lyar, the Miniſter of God. So he is in the falſe ſpirit gone out into the world. Contrary to 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. who knew all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Outward teaching is the way and meanes whereby the deep, and profound, and neceſſary truths of Scripture come to be underſtood, but not immediate,</hi> page 44.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So he hath denyed the ſpirit to open the Scriptures, immediate inſpiration by the ſpirit, and its teaching; and ſet up an outward in the room of it. Here his ſpirit is try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, gone out into the world. For ſalvation is immediate, and the means that brings to it, and none knows the Scriptures by outward teaching, but immediately by the Lord God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>Ministeriall gifts are not now to be found in the world, ſuch as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel had in the Primitive time.</hi>

               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>that the Apoſtle was ſilent in that point, that men muſt be endued with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts.</hi>

So you are another Miniſtry, and other Paſtors and Teachers, and that which is another gift then the Apoſtle, is not the gift of God.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>How comes the Apoſtle to raiſe up a living to ſome perſons for preaching, when he ſaith, That they that preach the Goſpel, must live of the Goſpel?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>page</hi> 48.</p>

               <p>A True title to his Book concerning his own condition, as his Book doth witneſſe himſelfe in the Apoſtacy, whoſe work is to oppoſe the light which doth <hi>enlighten every man that cometh into the world</hi> that <hi>John</hi> bore witneſſe of. So oppoſing the Covenant of God, of life and peace, and the foundation of God which ſtands ſure, Chriſt Jeſus, which he may as well ſay nothing, or do nothing. But the ſtone is ſet upon his head, and the foundation of God is layd, witneſſed by the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and

And as for the lyes and ſlanders in his Book, that are not worth mentioning, but they ſhall turn upon his own head, whoſe immodeſty hath diſcovered them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> In his Preface to the Reader He ſaith, <hi>It is an expreſſion of a darke deluded minde, to ſay that God is not diſtinguiſhed from the Saints.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But God and Chriſt is in the Saints, and dwell in them, and walk in them; and he is a Reprobate, and out of the Apoſtles doctrine.</p>
               <p>Pr He ſaith, <hi>We have broken the everlaſting Covenant of God.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe we own the teaching of God by his ſpirit. and the light <hi>which doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten every one that that cometh into the world,</hi> which is the covenant of God.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>The Scriptures is the rule of life. See</hi> page 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Contrary to Chriſt, who ſaid, <hi>the ſpirit ſhould lead them into all truth.</hi> And they that are the ſons of God, are <hi>led by the ſpirit of God.</hi> And the Churches was to hear what the ſpirit ſaith, for the ſpirit led them to ſpeak forth Scripture.</p>
               <p>Pr. Again he ſaith, <hi>It is a contradiction, and a confuſed ſenceleſſe thing to preach the word of faith in the mouth, and in the heart,</hi> ſee <hi>page</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Again he ſaith, <hi>Moſt ſenſeleſs is this profeſſion of Chriſt in the mouth, and believing in him with the heart, God that made all things.</hi> Theſe are his words, <hi>page</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not a ſenſeleſſe profeſſion to preach the word of Faith in the heart, and in the mouth; and to ſay, God will dwell in you, and the word is in the heart, and in the mouth. <hi>The word is God,</hi> and thou art ſenſeleſſe and fallen in confuſion in the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, out of the Apoſtles doctrine; and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt in you,</hi> and with the mouth confeſſion is made to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Pr. And he calls it <hi>a Notion, to ſay that Chriſt lighteth all, and therefore the light is Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So here he is kicking and ſpurning againſt the light Chriſt, <hi>that lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> which is the Rock, the foundation of God, the corner-ſtone, which is fallen upon thy head, and all be in the notion that be out of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſcoffs <hi>at the Quakers, becauſe they ſay they have the word of God in them.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>God bleſſing, or blaſting his owne Word to ſome according to the different ends intended by himſelfe,</hi> ſee <hi>page</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now the Word of God is not blaſted: God never blaſts his own Word, but it is they that are blaſted that diſobey the Word. For the Word of God doth its ſervice, and accompliſheth the end which it goeth forth for, and doth not return in vain: And it is the ſword of the ſpirit, and that is not blaſted. It is a <hi>hammer and a fire,</hi> and it lives, and doth endure for ever: So thou art blaſted, who ſaith, <hi>the Word of God he blaſts:</hi> and art to be cut down by the word of God for thy blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>the Quakers are deceivers,</hi> becauſe we ſay <hi>that Chriſt is not in outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and formes.</hi> And <hi>John Bunyan</hi> ſaith, <hi>that he is diſtinct from the Saints, and would have him in the forms,</hi> &amp;c. ſee <hi>page</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And we ſay he hath triumphed over the Ordinances, and blotted them out, and they are not to be touched; and the Saints have Chriſt in them, who is the end of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forms, and thou art deceived, who thinks to finde the living among the dead; and <hi>Bunyan</hi> is deceived, who ſaid, <hi>he is diſtinct from the Saints;</hi> and ſo you are a company of pittiful Teachers.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>Every true Chriſtian doth believe that the holy Scriptures alone is to be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>page</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So he hath thrown out God the giver of it, and Chriſt the Author of it; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have the Scriptures, and deny Chriſt the Author of faith, and object.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea, God ſaith, <hi>I will write my law in their hearts.</hi> The law was in <hi>Davids</hi> heart; the law was in the Apoſtles heart. The teſtimony of Jeſus <hi>is the ſpirit of prophecy,</hi> and that is in the heart. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>Rev.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Which is contrary to the Scriptures, for where the Church is, there is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the head Chriſt Jeſus: And God ſaith, <hi>I will give him for a covenant to the Gentiles,</hi> thoſe are the heathen: <hi>And I will make a new covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah,</hi> and theſe are called the people of God. And therefore thou art in the fall in ignorance, and a man without underſtanding, and affirms thou doſt not know what; and ſilence would become thee better then to publiſh thy ſhame in print, for they are not in the Church of God, that be not in the covenant of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>The Scriptures is the ſure and perfect rule,</hi> page 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And the Scripture ſaith, Chriſt is the Biſhop of the ſoule; and God hath all ſouls in his hand: And many have Scriptures, but their ſoules the Biſhop of them they know not, but they remain in death, and the life they want that gave it forth, and ſo are all on heaps about the Scripture one with another, and calling them the rule and the ſpirit; And the ſpirit of God that led them forth to ſpeak forth the Scripture, was the rule to the Saints and holy men of God: but they that be in the tranſgreſſion will kill one another about their words, and the ſpirit leads to ſee them again, and brings them into unity with them and God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>It is blaſphemy to ſay that Chriſt is in them as God and man,</hi> &amp;c. ſee <hi>page</hi> 23.</p>

               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>It is a fancy to ſay the eternall word of God is in them, ſee</hi> page 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thou art in the fancy that the eternal word is not in, and witneſſed, and under the fire and ſword, and hammer to be hammered down. And ſo art corrected by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, who ſaith, <hi>Let the word of God dwell in you richly,</hi> The <hi>ingrafted word which is able to ſave your ſouls,</hi> and immortal word, which is immortal.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>The Scriptures is the only rule of knowing God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>See</hi> page 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>none knoweth the father but the Son,</hi> who ſpoke among them that had the Scripture; and ſo he hath thrown out the Son, the rule of knowing the Father who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals him. For many had Scriptures who knew not the Father, nor knew the Son, nor heard his voyce, as in <hi>John</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>All thoſe that be without the Scriptures, are without all comfort, and hope, and God. See</hi> page 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here then is thy Doctrine, that none have comfort, none hope, none have God, but who have Scriptures. <hi>Abraham</hi> will tell thee otherwiſe, and <hi>Enoch,</hi> for thoſe knew God, and walked with him, and knew hope and comfort: and <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and God was with them before the Scriptures was written: And Chriſt was promiſed before the Scriptures was written, and many have the Scriptures, and not the comfort, nor the hope, but ſtand againſt him as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did againſt Chriſt.

                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>The Apoſtle doth not ſay that God in theſe last dayes doth ſpeak, or will ſpeak unto us by his Son; but God hath already in time paſt ſpoke by his Son, and that ſpeaking is to theſe laſt dayes, and we are not to look for any other ſpeaking, or revelation,</hi> &amp;c. page 39.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And ſo by this thou haſt denyed the ſcriptures, and the authority of them, which is Chriſt Jeſus, and denyed the Apoſtles doctrine, and the new covenant where the law is writ in the heart and minde, and all taught of God. Thou haſt thrown down and laid waſte Chriſts commands, who ſaith, <hi>Learn of me.</hi> And the command of God, who ſaith, <hi>This is my beloved Son, heare ye him:</hi> And ſo art ignorant of the ſcriptures and the power of God.</p>

The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſin.</hi> And many may ſpeak of Chriſt without them, and the body of ſin not dead: And ſo the Wolfe may get the form of godlineſſe, and the Devill may confeſs the ſon of God in words.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And yet he ſaith, the Scriptures is the rule, and it is the word; and ſo by that means have all men run into their ſenſes, into confuſion from the words of the Scriptures, which is not to be added to, nor taken from, nor can it be broken, nor is it of any private interpretation; and the Scriptures are the words of God, and Chriſt is the word, and in him they end, and the ſpirit is the rule.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>Doth not Christ approve of the Jewes opinion, in thinking that in the Scripture they ſhould have eternal life:</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt refers them to the Scriptures to finde life. See</hi> page 48.</p>

               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>This I do deny, that the perfection of the whole law of God is writ in mans heart, ſo as to know it, and do it, as it is written in the Prophets and Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>See</hi> page 64.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now is there any righteouſneſſe wrought by the grace of Chriſt, but what is by Chriſt who is the covenant of grace? and the power of God which is the Goſpel, <hi>which lighteth every man that comes into the world?</hi>

                  <hi>Pr.</hi> They call it <hi>conſcience, or a natural light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>page</hi> 11.</p>

The natural light, or made light, are created lights. He made the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the <hi>Stars,</hi> they were made: And here is the naturall lights to the natural eye. And the light that every man is enlightned with that cometh into the word, was before theſe were made, <hi>glorified with the Father before the world began,</hi> and before the name Conſcience was, or things was made, and then they was named, and the light doth exerciſe the conſcience towards God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man; which light cometh from Chriſt the Author of faith, which is held in the pure conſcience, who before the world began was glorified with the Father.</p>
               <p>Pr. Again, the light which cometh from Chriſt <hi>doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world,</hi> which diſcovers the evill, which will give thee power againſt it, man walking in it and yet brings to the reſt, to the Father, this they call <hi>free will,</hi> &amp;c. ſee <hi>page</hi> 12.</p>

So here they are corrected again; for the free-will and will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is out of the light which is Chriſt, which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of: And they that hate the <hi>light</hi> are out of Chriſt, and are not made free from the wrath to come; but they that be in the <hi>light</hi> are made free from the wrath to come, in covenant with God. So you that would ſet up another <hi>light</hi> then Chriſt, are Antichriſt, in your own wils; for all wil-worſhip, and fained humility is out of the <hi>light</hi> in the tranſgreſſion.</p>

And the holy women of old which was honourable, it was not the apparell that made them ſo to be, but the hidden man of the heart which was of great price to the Lord, which were brought to do the command of God: That honour which is in the world for cloaths and reſpect, God will ſtain, which ſtands in the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, and the luſt of the fleſh, and there ſtands the worlds honour in tranſgreſſion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Contrary to the Prophets, who bid people to ceaſe from men whoſe breath was in their noſtrils, therefore there is a teaching beyond it: And who comes to that, ſhall come to hear the Son: And the Apoſtles went to bring people off, to the end of the Prophets, and off of the Prieſts, and off the ordinances which the Prophets had eſtabliſhed in their place, and the Lord is come to teach his people himſelfe, where they need not ſay, <hi>know the Lord</hi> in the new covenant.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That is a lye, for it teacheth them to have all men in eſteem, and to honour all men in the Lord: Yet they are convinced by the Law to be tranſgreſſors, if they reſpect mens perſons; and they are not to hold the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt with reſpect of perſons as you do.</p>
               <p>And whereas thou ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit of God doth not teach to judge before the time,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>See</hi> page 6. And others ſay, <hi>the Saints ſhall not judge while they be upon the earth.</hi>

               <p>Pr. And this he calls <hi>a miſtake, to deny all thoſe that ſay they have faith in Chriſt, and yet their righteouſneſſe is not perfect, as the righteouſneſſe of Christ is perfect.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You are poyſoning the people, and are of the Whores ſtock, who would have blood to drink, which drunk of the blood of the Prophets and Martyrs, and Saints, and ſo lies provoking the zeale of the Magiſtrate againſt them, as the Phariſees and Prieſts did in ages paſt; but that was the blinde zeale that perſecuted in all Ages, and they are Anti-ſcripturall, Antichriſtian, and Anti-miniſteriall that deny the <hi>light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> which is the end and ſubſtance of the Scriptures; and who is in that, owns the Scriptures, and is not againſt them, and are the true Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Chriſtians; and ſo you are the <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> that deny the light that all men are enlightned withall.</p>
               <p>Pr. They ſay that <hi>the Quakers are in an errour, to ſay, that none are the Ministers of God, and called of him, who are ſent forth by the authority of man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>page</hi> 7.</p>

               <p>Pr. They ſay, <hi>That is another errour of the Quakers, that ſay, he who is not infallible in his judgement, when he gives counſell and advice, is no Miniſter of Chriſt. See</hi> page 7.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96882:34"/> You may well creep and go to the Magiſtrates for help, who denies infallibility, and ſo naturall men knows not the things of God with the earthly ſpirit of the world.

As for the not faſhioning your ſelves according to the world in your former luſts of ignorance, that is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Apoſtle: And as for the forſaking of <hi>gorgeous apparell,</hi> naughtineſs, and ſuperfluity; they are corrected by the Scriptures, and judged by the ſpirit: And as for <hi>drinking to one another,</hi> and tempting one another with Beer, and bowing the Hat, and reſpecting and honouring the Creature, which is earthly <hi>Adams</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the Fall, which Chriſt receiveth it not, the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> And as for reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of perſons, they that do ſo <hi>commit ſin, and are convinced of the Law as tranſgreſſors.</hi> And now ſee where thou waſt, and all the Prieſts in your ſeduced perſwaſions, and judgeth good of evill, and evill good: And thou and the Prieſts may ſee that all this that which thou did from thy own perſwaſions, is thy own will: But that which led thee from ſin, and from the world, to righteouſneſſe, was owned, that ſhall be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ever againſt thee and all the Prieſts, and ſtand a witneſſe againſt you, though now thou art in the flower of thy age.

That is a ſound ſpeech which cannot be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>And all people upon the earth that have run out in their imaginations, whereby truth comes to be hurt; if they have done it willingly, the greater ſhall be their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, they ſhall be whipt however. But all you that have bent your wills, and

               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>That no man by that native light inherent in him had power to believe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>See</hi> page 26.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The light <hi>which doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world,</hi> he calls it <hi>native, and inherent:</hi> He gives theſe names to it, which is the light <hi>which doth enlighten every man,</hi> &amp;c. there is power in the light given to believe: But now <hi>he that hateth the light, hateth the power,</hi> and ſo the <hi>light is his condemnation;</hi> The names he gives, as <hi>native</hi> and <hi>inherent,</hi> are his own out of the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>The Scripture doth not ſet forth a certain allowance for Miniſters, but it is left to humane prudence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>See</hi> page 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So he is flown from Chriſts words and the Apoſtles, who with the wiſdome of God ſet down the Miniſters allowance, and did not leave it to humane policy in after ages for maintenance for Miniſters: For the humane policy will feed the falſe Prophets, as the Prophets, and Chriſt, and the Apoſtles declare of in Scripture, whoſe ſpirits is ſeen with the ſpirit that gave forth Scripture, gone out into the earth, who were covetous, and ſo idolaters, ordering with the earthly policy, which is humane and earthly.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>Abrahams obedience was not an act of the body,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So all the works of God are mediate now by his principle; Then none have the ſpirit of Chriſt by his concluſion, which is immediate, to work immediately; and none hears Gods voice, and none ſent from God, and Chriſt is with none of them then.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So here then, thou prays and the Spirit moves not, and preacheth, and the Spirit moves not: So then the ſpirit of errour is it that moves thee: And contrary to all them that gave forth the Scriptures, the Prophets and Miniſters of God, <hi>who ſpoke as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And thou art never likely to read the Scripture, but by the ſame that gave them forth, nor know them, nor none upon the earth, nor know God of whom they learned that gave them forth, and was taught of him, and ſo art no Miniſter of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Not to preach, nor to pray but as the ſpirit moves;</hi> This he ſaith, <hi>in a ſort is to ſhut up the Kingdome of God from the ſons of men, and brings men to neglect their duty, and is the gap where the deluſion of Satan comes in, and draws men to ſluggiſhneſs. And how can glad tidings be known, unleſſe they be told,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now they are all in the ſluggiſhneſs, <hi>ſhutting up the Kingdome of heaven against men,</hi> under the deluſion of Satan, and none can bring the glad tidings, but as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit moves them: And they who go when the Spirit doth not move them, they are they that run and the Lord never ſent them; who pray, or ſpeak without the moving of the ſpirit, they are out of the path of all the holy men of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>It is the priviledge of the Bereans that is to try an Apostle,</hi> &amp;c. Again he ſaith, <hi>They are to put up their ſupplications when the ſpirit doth not move them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>See</hi> page 45.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now ſee if God ever accepted that which was not moved from the Spirit: God who is a ſpirit never accepted that; and that which tries the Apoſtles is the light, and gives the <hi>Bereans</hi> to believe the Scriptures which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>Far be it from me to imagine that the ſpirit of God moved the Apoſtles to preach when they did onely, and not at other times, and that they always waited in ſilence till then,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>See</hi> ſame page.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So he would make it that the Apoſtles preached when the ſpirit moved them not, and run without the moving of the ſpirit, and ſo would make them like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: And <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>they ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And they that are the ſons of God, are led by the ſpirit of God. <hi>And the ſpirit ſhall lead them into all truth:</hi> And the ſpirit ſhould tell them what they ſhould ſpeak, and ſhew them things to come, and that was their guide and rule; and thou who ſpeaks, and not the ſpirit moves thee, art no Miniſter of the ſpirit, and ſayes, far be it from thee to imagine the Apoſtles preached onely when they were moved, and ſo doth not own the Apoſtles were the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the ſpirit, with thy imaginations.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>And the ſinging of the Saints in the ſpirit and grace, is not like the ungodly ſinging without the ſpirit.</hi>

Why may not others learn the ſame books, and writings, and ſo come to be Teachers and Paſtors as well as you, ſeeing you have nothing but from Books and Writings, and old Authors?

So no tythes paid to the ſimilitude and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But all is to come to the Son, and to hear the Son, and honor the Son. <hi>I will give him for a Covenant of light unto the Gentiles</hi> and a new Covenant to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Judah.</hi> Among the Jews to whom Chriſt was promiſed, he told them he was the light of the world; and the Prophet ſaid <hi>he would give him for a Covenant of light unto the Gentiles.</hi> And Chriſt bid them <hi>believe in the Light,</hi> and they ſhould have the Light of life, and they ſhould not walk in darkneſs. And <hi>John</hi> ſaith <hi>if ye walk in the Light then have ye fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of the Son of God cleanſeth you from all ſin.</hi> So none cometh out of the darkneſs, and out of the ſtumbling: and have peace with God, but who cometh to the Light. And art thou offended at this object? Doſt thou ſtumble at this Light? at the door, the Rock, the corner-ſtone, ſplitting thy ſelf againſt it, but it is fallen upon thy head. Again the ſpiritual man diſcerns and Judgeth all things; And as face anſwers face, ſo doth the Spirit of the Lord in man: And man may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern by the Spirit of the Lord God, where the ſeed is in the Death, and where the ſeed is not, and where the ſoul is living, (in which the Lord hath pleaſure) and where it is in the death, as the Scriptures of truth doth teſtifie.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Many had the Scriptures, but ſtood againſt the Son of God; and many may have the Scriptures, and not the Son of God. The Son of God is not Writings, Scriptures ſignifies writings: And many may have the Scriptures, and not have the Son of God, and ſo not eternall life: For the Devill hath Scripture, but hath not eternall life; <hi>for he that envyeth his brother, hath not eternall life abiding in him.</hi> So who have eternal life, they have that which the Scripture ſpeaks of, teſtifies of, it teſtifies of Chriſt the life, of the ſpirit, and ſo they are the words given forth by the ſpirit of God, and ſo are to be fulfilled by the ſame ſpirit again. And the Scriptures are able <hi>to make wiſe unto ſalvation through faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> For they were not <hi>wiſe unto ſalvation,</hi> who had the ſpirit without the faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>We attain our Goſpell another way then</hi> Paul <hi>did. And it is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to tell us that what ye deliver is by revelation from heaven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You have received your Goſpell another way then <hi>Paul</hi> did I do believe, who are apoſtates from them: And is it not blaſphemy for you to ſpeak, and preach that which ye have not received from heaven? &amp; ſo ye have brought your ſelves under the curſe, and ſhewed another Goſpel. For whoſoever receiveth the Goſpel which is called the power of God, it is immediate, and by immediate revelation from God from heaven; And ſo your Goſpel which is of men, and after men is another, not the power of God, received from God; for whoſoever receiveth the Goſpel, the power of God, muſt receive it immediately, for the power of God is immediate; and that is the glad tidings to poor ſouls, that ſets the ſouls free, which is immediate.</p>

And ſo Chriſt doth not any where to his Diſciples (who ended the true command that gave <hi>tythes</hi>) give forth his Diſciples an order to ſet up another Law in the Nations to give them <hi>tythes,</hi> the <hi>tythes</hi> of mens eſtates, and ſo you are none of the Order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> never come thither; but of the order of them which Chriſt ſaid ſhould come, who are inwardly ravened, which <hi>John</hi> ſaw was come, &amp; went forth from them, the falſe ſpirit that went forth into the world, into the earth; and ſo ye have ſet up <hi>Tythes,</hi> and Temples, and Schools, and Prieſts by the Popes authority. Had yee not your <hi>Spiritual Courts</hi> not long ſince? And was not the Pope the firſt author of your <hi>Tythes?</hi> And are not you of that Order? (far off of that ſpirit that leads after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi>) for ye are ravened from the ſpirit: For none comes to the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> but who comes to the ſpirit of Chriſt, <hi>and theſe are Kings and Prieſts to God for ever.</hi> So ye have received your <hi>Tythes</hi> after the order of that ſpirit that went forth from the Apoſtles into the world, into the earth, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ravened, and went forth from the Apoſtles, which the world have been after ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, and have had the ſheeps cloathing, but ravened and devoured the Lambs, and worried the ſheep, Miniſters, Prophets, and Saints: So your Order will all men comprehend (that be of the royall Prieſt-hood after the order of <hi>Melchizedeck</hi>) to be come of the Popes ſtock, for the Apoſtles and Chriſt did not ſet up <hi>Tythes.</hi>

And the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of <hi>John</hi> was a type of that within; And <hi>you</hi> to a particular, which is your cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, which the Scripture doth not declare to us, that that cuſtom was in the Church of God. But the Apoſtle bid them <hi>keep to the form of ſound words, that could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> Now <hi>you</hi> to a particular is not a found word, as they can tell that have but read either the Bible or Accidence: And there is no Heatheniſh cuſtomes comes into the Church of God that will ſpot or wrinkle it, nor nothing cometh into it (that is the pillar and ground of <hi>Truth</hi>) that will be condemned.</p>

And none can know Chriſt by the Scriptures, they teſtifie of him; but none can know Chriſt but by <hi>Revelation;</hi> fleſh and blood had not revealed it to <hi>Peter;</hi> and the Son was revealed in the Apoſtle; and none can preach Chriſt (that deny <hi>revelation</hi>) in truth; and they that are <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> they be in his doctrine; For when they are out of his Doctrine and his commands, then they are wrong <hi>Miniſters</hi> which miniſters not for Chriſt, but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96882:54"/> they preach themſelves, and are <hi>Antichriſts</hi> tranſgreſſors: And the Scripture doth not tell any where, <hi>that Baptiſme is a Chriſtians circumciſion,</hi> as ſprinkling Infants; but Circumciſion in the ſpirit, and Baptiſme in the ſpirit is all one, in which the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> All that ever come to know Chriſt (you and all the people upon the Earth) it muſt be by <hi>revelation;</hi> for no man knows Chriſt but by <hi>revelation.</hi> And all that ever own Chriſt, they muſt own <hi>the light that doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world</hi> to be the covenant of God; which <hi>light</hi> men are to believe in; which not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in, they are reprobated.

The Scriptures teſtifie of him, but they that had the Scriptures knew him not, but who was in the light, and in the Covenant; and ſo ye have all diſcovered your ſelves in the apoſtacy, apoſtatized from the Apoſtles ſpirit; and all to be the falſe ſpirits gone out into the earth, into the world for means, for maintenance, and ſo ye are all puft up in your pride; and ſo that makes all your doctrine to be ſo dry and ſo barren, there being no revelation among you, nor no immediate ſpeaking from God and Chriſt, but feeding people with the husk, with the outſide. And have proved your ſelves here to be but the Wolfe in the ſheeps cloathing, inwardly ravened from the ſpirit: But with it ye are comprehended; and if it had not been ſo, you would never have publiſhed your folly to the Nation.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> None are converted but who be in the ſpirit that gave forth thoſe Epiſtles, though they may have all the Epiſtles: For that hath been the Papiſts and your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings who hath had the Epiſtles, by the Epiſtles, out of the life, ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, and ſo made proſelites Phariſee-like; For that baptizeth, and that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth, for in that is the fellowſhip and the unity. People (as I ſaid to you before) may get the ſheeps cloathing as ye have long time been covered with, but inwardly ye have been ravening wolves, as your fruits have declared, as the <hi>Northern</hi> part of the nation may make it manifeſt. The witneſſe in all your conſciences ſhall anſwer for me, and let you ſee that your own words are your burden, and an heavy cry will come upon you when ye feel it, who now are fat, and full, and freſh, and luſty; but a day of requiring is coming, and inquiſition is made for the blood that hath been ſhed of all the Prophets, Martyrs, and Saints ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, and the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the perſecuting by you and your off-ſpring got up ſince the dayes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; the falſe ſpirits that went out into the world, that are now ſtanding againſt the <hi>light which doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world:</hi> So marks that you be inwardly ravened, and that you be the Antichriſts and the falſe Prophets, you are not like to own <hi>the light in every man</hi> who are ravened from it, and are turned againſt them that walke in the light, and keep the teſtimony of Jeſus. Here is the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet that makes war againſt the Saints, and overcomes them for a time; but the Lamb and the Saints muſt have the victory. And you (about <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>) Miniſters and Teachers, are like to a heap or dunghil, ſogged and mudded; but come to the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, elſe eternally you will be condemned.</p>

                  <hi>Pr.</hi> They ſay, <hi>Bleſſed are they that heare the Word, and keep it; which is a word ſpoken and written, not the eternall word. It is a notion of the Word of God, to call the Word of God a Declaration. And the holy Scriptures is able to make men wiſe unto Salvation, to the Law and Teſtimony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To the Law and to the Teſtimony; <hi>The law is light,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon:</hi> And <hi>the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Jeſus is the ſpirit of prophecy.</hi> And many may have the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet be out of the Light, and out of the Teſtimony as you, and ſo out of the ſpirit of prophecy. For <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had the teſtimony before <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> &amp; <hi>John,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations</hi> was written, and bid them come to the Law and to the Teſtimony; and you that do not ſpeak according to that rule, it is becauſe you hate the light in you. And the Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> calls them a Declaration, who was a Miniſter of the Word, and the Scriptures are the words of God, and the words of Chriſt, and ſo not the Word, but the words which the Word Chriſt fulfills. So ye are men not capable, nor of a true underſtanding to divide the word aright, nor to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to the wearyed, but do all lead the halt, and lame, and blinde out of the way; who for ſo doing muſt find miſery.</p>
               <p>Again, they that hear the Word of God, they hear that which lives and doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever; and this Word is eternall which lives, and doth endure for ever, which they have within them; and with that they ſee the words, and letters, and writings, or outward Tables may be broken, but ſtill the Word remains. That ever the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>that the Scriptures are able to make men wiſe unto ſalvation,</hi> and leave out faith; you are no more made wiſe then the Phariſees was with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96882:55"/> without faith: The Phariſees were not made wiſe unto ſalvation by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without the faith, neither are you: But who are in the faith, they are <hi>made wiſe to ſalvation</hi> through the Scriptures, and comes to Chriſt the end of them; for it gives to ſee the Scriptures, and in it (in the faith) is the unity which Scribes and Phariſees, and Apoſtates are out of.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That a mediate call ſince the time of the Apoſtles; and that the Officers and Elders of the Church are to be ordained by a mediate way, the power without the perſon, government without governour is a meer fancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Since the dayes of the Apoſtles, that Chriſt ſaid ſhould come, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ravened, that went forth from the Apoſtles, the falſe-ſpirit gone out into the world, and the world hath run after them. They can ſpeak no therwiſe but of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate call; and their Elders and Members are made mediately, and ſo have all erred from the power and ſpirit of God (of that which they call a Church) and this is ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles. For all Elders and Officers of the Church of God (the pillar and ground of Truth) they are made immediately by the ſpirit: For the Church is ſpirituall, elſe how ſhould they ſee the things that are immediate, or behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Church of the living God, which is the ground and pillar of Truth, the Church, which is in God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The power of God rules and orders people when there is no outward government: Nay, it ſtrikes down government of men and governors, as in the days of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and in many other places of Scripture mentioned, the power of God ſtrikes down government and Governours out of it, and this is the power that is honoured which ſtrikes down falſe governours and Government and which is not a fancie as you ignorantly ſay.</p>
               <p>Pr. And ye ſay <hi>Chriſt doth not forbid to be called of men maſter in the expreſſion of civil honour, and we will warrant a Pulpit from the Scripture,</hi> Ezra's <hi>example: and</hi> ye ſay <hi>they that ſtand praying in the Synagogues that are reproached as Antichriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They that pray for mony, and Preach for mony, and get up a Pulpit and plead <hi>Ezras</hi> example, They might have pleaded the Phariſees had the chiefeſt ſeat; they are ignorant of Chriſt the Light, and the life, and the power; who came to put an end to <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the Pulpit both; who Preached up and down the mountains, and wilderneſſes and denyed the Phariſees praying, and all that are got up there without the power, and that is the Antichriſt that is got up in the long robe, and praying for mony, and pleads <hi>Ezras</hi> Pulpit; and ſaith it is a civil honour to be called <hi>of men master,</hi> and ſo ſlights and tranſgreſſeth Chriſts Commands, and calls it civil reſpect; theſe I ſay are they that have gotten the ſheepes clothing upon their backes, but inwardly ravened from the ſpirit of God, and deceives the world. But now their hypocriſie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hid, but muſt come to light, and be publiſhed upon the houſe top, and give light to the whole houſe, and not under the buſhell, and the children of light ſhall ſhine that men ſhall come to glorifie their Father which is in heaven; and you Antichriſts in the Apoſtacy has got up in <hi>Ezras</hi> Pulpit which comes to end.</p>
               <p>Pr. They ſay <hi>it is a civil reſpect to ſay you to one. Again Chriſt laid down the very reaſon why his diſciples ſhould take neither gold nor ſcrip, but wholly depend upon the means due unto them for Preaching,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> When ſaw we the <hi>New castle</hi> Prieſts go out in this manner, without gold or ſcrip, and wholly depending on the Preaching of the Goſpel? Or when ſaw we any of them called Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> do ſo? go without a ſcrip, depending only upon Preaching the Goſpel? nay are not there Petitions flying up and down the Nations to the Magiſtrates for maintenance, enough to ſhame both Magiſtrates, and Church, and themſelves too, if they had any ſhame; that their flocks, and Vineyards would not maintain them; to ſhame all the people that ever they have Preached too, and make people ſo aſhamed of them to turn their backs on them. For they cannot ſay that they have lived upon the Goſpel, but they have lived upon the States, and what they have got by ravening, He that lives upon the Goſpel gets a flock and gets a Vineyard, ye are found in the Popes maintenance (which is tithes and offerings from men) and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96882:55"/> not in the maintenance of Chriſt which he allowed to his diſciples, whom he is with to the end of the world. Now theſe are States Miniſters made by man; and ſo have their allowance ſo put in, and taken out by men; ſo are out of the allowance of Chriſt which he gives to his diſciples whom he is with to the end of the world: which you may ſee ye are out of the ſteps of them; and will appear to all ſober people to be the Apoſtates, in the Apoſtacy ravened from the ſpirit of the living God; and the power the Apoſtles was in, who ſaid <hi>have not I power to eat and to drink;</hi> not great ſums of mony, Stipends and Gleab-lands, and tithes ſet forth by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. And the Apoſtles often would not uſe their power to eat, though they had power. And never did any of the Prophets, or Apoſtles bring up their people they Preached too with an hour-glaſſe, no ſuch form or cuſtome, or when any ſpake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their hour glaſſe, they had a law to priſon, that is the beaſt that doth ſo, that quencheth the ſpirit, and is not the Miniſtery of Chriſt. And doth not many of you ſhake the glaſſe, and think the time long? And you could not tell when to give over, and you would run all into confuſion but for a glaſſe. And is not this carnal glaſſe your limit? See how ye can Preach without it, and ſo tell well when ye have done without a ſickneſs in your ſpirits, which muſt have a carnal to limmit them: which ſhewes man hath not power over his own ſpirit. And the power of God know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This I ſay, none be Miniſters of the ſpirit, nor none be in the ſpirit, nor none have the ſpirit of Chriſt, nor the holy Ghoſt, nor the ſpirit of the Father ſpeaking in them, but who have that which is infallible, and in that which is infallible. And they be in the lying ſpirit and hypocriſie that be out of it, and all the falſe ſpirits that is gone out into the world: So ye do well to confeſſe that ye have not the infallible ſpirit, yee are not infallible, and ſo no Miniſters of the ſpirit: And how can they but delude peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are not infallible, and are none of Chriſts, which have not the ſpirit which is infallible, and are not Miniſters of the Goſpell, which is the power of God, which is infallible.</p>

Therefore they that be covetous, will take them by violence from the people. But them that are come to the Goſpel allowance; freely ye have received, freely give: What they ſet before them, of that they are to eat, preach the Goſpel, live of the Goſpel; theſe triumph and trample upon the firſt Prieſt-hood, types, figures, and ſhadows, ſees the Prieſt-hood is changed, the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

Now ſaith he of the things (for tythes were things before the Law, and in the Law) of the things which we have ſpoken this is the ſum, Chriſt a Miniſter of the Sanctuary which God hath pitched and not man. So there is the ſum of the things and the ſubſtance: and the plentious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that leads men out of the earth, that brings them to lay down all at the feet of the Apoſtles, which is beyond tenthes which was to the ſervice of the Lord due; Here the earth cometh to be known to be the Lords; it is given up here, and man Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed out of it, of this glorious Goſpel are ye all ignorant; and ſo Tithes is not as <hi>Annanias,</hi> to be compared with <hi>Annanias,</hi> not now; and not as a tribute, but as a cuſtome, which ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles in the apoſtacy, that the Nations have drunk the whores cup, there have been <hi>Queens</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> that have made Lawes, that is gone out of the power of Chriſt which the Apoſtles was in, into the beaſts power, and made Schools to make their Miniſters, and have ſet up Tenths; So this cuſtome of the ſin, hath taken away the ſence of it, that people have been hardened that they have torn people, ſpoiled their goods, and caſt into priſon, and taken treble dammages, and kept them in priſon, and haled them before Courts and Seſſions, Aſſizes, and Benches; which is not like the Miniſters of Chriſt; for the law is changed of God that gave tenths, and ſince that was changed, the Law in the heart, and a new Covenant; And ſince the apoſtacy from that, men have got the ſheepes cloathing ravened from the ſpirit, wolves whoſe fruits declare it; who have deceived Nations, and the world, and have got up a Law from man, and a command from man, the Pope being the Author; and the Law of God is changed; and the command of God is changed that gave tithes, and they have got up this to take them, the Law of man, the command of man; and the Law of God and his command is denyed, ſpoken by the Apoſtle <hi>Heh.</hi> 7. which all that be in the wiſdom of God ſees over theſe things, and feels over them, and Judges you all, and executes Judgement, and is in the power and Authority to execute Judgement, and convince all, and are in the honour of Saints. So your Miniſtry, if Tithes fall, is weakened; but the Miniſtry of Chriſt came in, when Tithes fell, and that Miniſtry fell that held up tithes, and that Prieſthood which the Prieſts lips was to preſerve the peoples knowledge. So by the fall of that Miniſtry that took Tithes, the Miniſtry of Chriſt came in, is the riſe of this Miniſtry ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles in the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy that is made by Kings, Biſhops, Popes, Schools, and Colledges? in the fall, this Miniſtry that takes tithes, (which Tithes falling ſay they, and ſaith thou the hand is weakened of the Miniſtry) it is not the power that ſtrengthens the hand but the earthly.</p>

And this is not to deny Chriſt, but receive him, and believe in him. And all upon the earth be Antichriſts, that denies the <hi>light that doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world,</hi> and be from it.</p>
               <p>Pr. And as for your ſpeaking <hi>of judging, and not to judge before the time untill the Lord do come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That was ſpoken to the <hi>Corinthians, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſse, and make manifeſt the counſels of the heart.</hi> Now the ſame Apoſtle ſaid to the ſame <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that God would dwell in them, and walk in them; and they were not to judge before the time untill that he did come. And he told them <hi>the Saints ſhould judge the world,</hi> and the world ſhould be judged by them. Now where the Lord is come, ſuch as have the Son, and the Father, and bring this Doctrine, they are to be received; and they know where ſin and tranſgreſſion is finiſhed, and where it is ſtanding: So if any man have an ear to hear this, and can receive it, let him.</p>
               <p>And as for the reſt of the things in your Book, your ſilence might have covered your ſhame, <hi>for every mans words ſhall be his burthen.</hi> Therefore he that hath the word of God, and ſpeaks that that ſhall not be ſo, which now comes to be richly known, and is known among the Saints and Believers, the true Church which is come out of the Apoſtacy, ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, to that the Apoſtles was in.</p>

And if people have all the Scriptures, and not the Spirit (which was before they was given forth) they want the ſtanding rule; they cannot know the Scriptures; they cannot worſhip God aright; they cannot finde eternall life; they have not unity with God, neither do they worſhip God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; but who be in the ſpirit that gave them forth: And we do believe you, that immediate revelations now by the holy ſpirit of God revealing things to you im-immediately ye have not; and you ſay it is not the work of Gods ſpirit now, nor the way of God now, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You that have ravened from the ſpirit of God inwardly, have been the Wolves which Chriſt ſaid ſhould come, which <hi>John</hi> ſaw was come, which the world hath gone after you, and yee have burſt into Names, and Heads, &amp; Horns, and Sects. And the power was given to the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophets, and the great Whore hath corrupted the earth: All Nations have drunk her cup of fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Kings of the Earth. So they have flown to the Kings for help againſt the Saints and againſt the <hi>Lamb,</hi> but the <hi>Lamb</hi> and the Saints ſhall have the victory. And ſo when you have been ravened from the ſpirit of God, it hath not been like yee ſhould attain to immediate Revelation by the ſpirit of God. But now who are come to the Lamb, are come to that ye ravened from, they witneſſe immediate <hi>Revelation.</hi> They are come to that the Apoſtles was in, the ſpirit of Chriſt, the ſpirit of God, they witneſſe immediate <hi>Revelation.</hi> Who are come into the feare of God, the things of God is revealed unto them; who are come into the ſpirit of God, it reveals to them the deep things of God. So you that deny immediate revelation by Gods holy ſpirit now, and diſcovering things to you immediately; you have ſhewed your ſpirits to be the falſe ſpirits, unclean ſpirits that be in the earth, like the Frogs that go out of the mouth of the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet, which was diſcovered by <hi>John,</hi> and revealed to <hi>John,</hi> diſcovered and made manifeſt; which now with the ſame holy ſpirit of God are you all apoſtates revealed and diſcovered to the children of the Light, to the Lambs and the Saints, who witneſſe the ſpirit of God which reveales the things of God to them, and immediate revelation. As ever the falſe Prophets, falſe Apoſtles, falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, in their falſe propheſies and teachings did, who had gotten the form, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the power, immediate Revelation by Gods holy ſpirit.

And when they were ravened from the ſpirit of God they got the <hi>ſheeps cloathing,</hi> inwardly ravening wolves, <hi>which if it were poſſible, they would deceive the very elect;</hi> which went forth from the Apoſtles in the apoſtacy, and ſince, they have deceived the Nations, the wolves, the inwardly raveners, though covered with the <hi>ſheeps cloathing.</hi> And here theſe things have been among you in the apoſtacy: And the Apoſtates have reigned and rul'd, and have had the dominion ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles; But now (with that which ye all have ravened from) are ye made manifeſt and comprehended. So this man of ſin with his lying ſignes and wonders, who ravened from the ſpirit of God as the Devill did, who went from the Truth, is he that compels all his members to plead for the body of ſin while they be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, and ſo to keep them out of the faith of Gods Elect, that gives the victory over the world: And ſuch he cannot deceive, nor none of his members, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened from the ſpirit of God.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God is not a reſpecter of perſons, as ſaith the Apoſtle, for his Covenant he gives to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as to the <hi>Jewes.</hi> And the faith of Gods elect is held with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reſpect of perſons; and he that reſpects perſons commits ſin, and tranſgreſſeth the Law.

And many if they have Scriptures, they have not the ground of faith, untill they have Chriſt the Author of it, and God the giver of it, <hi>which is able to make wiſe unto ſalvation</hi> through the faith which Chriſt is the Author of.

               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>We willingly acknowledge we are fallible men, that may be deceived; and to finde infallible Teachers is against experience.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If every one that hath the Scriptures hath the fountain, hath the Devill the fountain? for he can bring Scriptures: Hath he the Fountain and Well of living waters? Nay we ſay, God and Chriſt is the fountain of all good: And ſaith <hi>David, all the ſprings are in him.</hi> And ſo many may have the Scriptures, and yet want the waters, want the fountain; which hath had them ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, which have had them this many hundreds of yeares in the Apoſtacy, the ſheeps cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and have known no other Fountain but it, nor no other Well: So there hath all the leanneſſe of ſoules been among people, that they have not known the Fountain of whom they learned that gave forth Scriptures. And we do believe you that yee are fallible men, that ſay <hi>the Scriptures is the well and fountain of living waters,</hi> and you are not infallible. And it is contrary to your experience to be infallible: And we ſay the Pope is not infallible neither, though he be your Father, the Ancient.

And ſuch be in the fondneſs, and have the Scripture and put that for the word, which is words. And ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles in your Churches; your Miniſters, your Elders, your makers of your Miniſters, have been all mediate, and ſo it is ordinary as ye call it. But before the Apoſtacy, in the days of the Apoſtles we ſay neither Elders, nor Miniſters, was mediate: But that which made the elders, was the Holy-Ghoſt, to overſee; and that which brought them to miniſter was immediate: and ſo they was Miniſters of the ſpirit, and all Elders made by the mediate, is carnal, earthly, and their weapons are earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and their rule which they over-ſee withall is earthly. Therefore hath your Church broken into ſo many pieces: and they divide, and cannot hold together like earth, becauſe ye are not in an Immediate ſpirit.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Falſe Prophets are enemies, yet they are not to ſlay them; now the Apoſtles did not wreſtle againſt the fleſh and the blood, with the falſe Prophets, at you Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters do now; though <hi>Saul</hi> did before he was <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſhewed himſelf of your nature you be now in unconverted; And who ever be not in that ſtate to witneſs Chriſt in them manifeſt in their fleſh: and there condemning ſin in the fleſh; that they may through him become the righteouſneſs of God; they be in their fancies: And Chriſt deſtroyes the ground of all fancy, and brings to ſee where there is no ſhadow nor changing, and brings their conſcience into liberty, and waſheth it and ſprinckling it, where the Miniſtery of faith is held in it. And your <hi>laying on of hands,</hi> (ſince the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy from the Apoſtles) is not as the Apoſtles, who have not an infallible ſpirit, nor are infallible, (nor called immediately) as they were; none of them you lay on your hands can receive the Holy Ghoſt, who you your ſelves are not in the immediate ſpirit, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,

And every one that knowes Juſtification, Redemption, righteouſneſs and ſalvation, this is all known within us, elſe people be in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> drove from God, not come to the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> not knowing ſalvation in the ground, Juſtification in the ground, Redemption in the ground. If Chriſt the righteouſneſs of God, Redemption, Juſtification, and ſalvation, the righteouſneſs be not felt within, and found within, they are Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates. And the Reprobates may talk of it without; but where that is, there is ſalvation, righteouſneſs, Redemption, Juſtification, &amp;c. And Chriſt doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world him by whom the world was made before it was made, which light people are to believe in; which is not natural: which gives to ſee over the nature, before the natural was? for the natural lights are the Sun, the Moon, and Stars which may be ſeen with a viſible eye: which Chriſt the light, the Covenant of light to <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the ſalvation to the ends of the earth, which doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world, that all men through him might believe. Here is God no reſpector of perſons; he that believeth in the light, ſhall be ſaved: and he that doth not, is condemned. And he comes to be a Child of light, who believes in the light: and now ſhall the world be reproved, for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in the light, and <hi>humane learning is that which is earthly, and natural;</hi> that doth not open the heavenly: that which reveales the things of God, is the Spirit of God, beyond all the worlds wiſdom. For that you call humane learning, and humane ſoul, and humane body, is earthly, not heavenly, nor underſtands them. The earth is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſo they that are of the earth, and they that is from above ſpeak of the things above, and ſo they that are below meaſure by the earthly wiſdom below, and ſo that which gives to underſtand the heavenly things, is the ſpirit of God and the ſpiritual wiſdom; which is not of man, nor from man; for ſaith the Apoſtle neither knowes any man the things of God, but the Spirit of God.</p>

And the Goſpel they Preached, the power of God, it opened the hearts of the people to give unto them, and not by an outward Law. And the great work of the Apoſtles was not to wrangle about their maintenance, as it is the great work of the Miniſters now, (in the world made by men) in our age: and ſuch as do Divine for mony, and propheſie for mony, And hire, was ever looked upon to be the falſe Prophets wages without the ſpirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures, and the falſe ſpirits in the earth; for the Spirit of God would never value, equal, or meaſure his gift with the earthly things And when the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of <hi>the labourer, is worthy of his hire,</hi> he ſaith <hi>who goes a warfare at his own charge;</hi> and they that was taught, they was to communicate every good thing to them, this ſtill was ſpoken among the Saints this was not ſpoken in Temples, and Synagogues, and them that took Tythes; for thoſe was warred againſt by them that was in the ſubſtance: and the warfare was to bring people to the ſubſtance; out of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> to the ſecond; and out of the ſhadowes. And that whereby the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters had the double honour, it was in the life, and in the power: ſuch as meaſured not a gift with earthly things; which brought them to lay down all their eſtates at the Apoſtles feet; which was more then Tythes.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt did not put the Scriptures above himſelfe; he ſaid, <hi>All judgement was committed to the Son, and for judgement he was come into the world.</hi> And the Phariſees that had the Scriptures they could not judge of Faith, nor of controverſie, nor knew not Chriſt the Author of the Faith; nor none can judge but who be in the ſpirit that gave forth the Scriptures. And the Scriptures was given forth from them that was in the faith of Truth; but ſuch as be not in the faith, knows not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, neither is it able <hi>to make them wiſe unto ſalvation</hi> without the Faith. For the Phariſees and chief Prieſts were not, though they had Scripture, and they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and condemned the Author of Faith, that had Scriptures without the life; and ſo do all that are out of the life ſtill that have the Scriptures, judge the Author of the Faith, Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>who doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world:</hi> And the holy ſpirit ſpake in them that gave forth the Scriptures, and ſo they ſpoke it forth.</p>
               <p>Now they that be from the ſpirit of God in their owne particulars ſpeaking there, knows not the ſpirit that ſpoke in them that ſpoke them forth; but ſuch are they that ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit ſpeakes in the Scriptures.</hi> Such are the Miniſters of the <hi>Letter,</hi> and not of the <hi>Spirit</hi> that gave it forth. And the ſpirit that gave forth the Scripture is that which judged of all conditions, which gave them the ſpirituall underſtanding. For people have not the ſpirituall underſtanding to judge, and to diſcern if they have all the Scriptures, unleſſe they be in the ſpirit that gave it forth: And ſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe without the ſpirit that gave it forth, cannot be the Judge of Controverſie, nor of Faith, but is a dead <hi>Letter</hi> in it ſelfe, but the ſpirit is it that gave forth Scriptures.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt within is beyond all mens righteouſneſſe, or holineſſe, for he is the righteouſneſſe it ſelfe. And the Aſſembly of Divines gave forth a Catechiſme, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Parliament, for people to learn; wherein they ſay, <hi>that the Holy Ghoſt is equall in power and glory with the Father.</hi> Now every one that cometh to witneſſe the Son of God, and the holy Ghoſt that gave forth the Scriptures by your account, they witneſſe that which is equall in power and glory with God. And doth not the Aſſembly give forth this in their Catechiſme, that people ſhould learn? And is it blaſphemy for to come to witneſſe this which you have given forth, and the minde which was in Chriſt?

So with the light thou art comprehended to be a Miniſter of darkneſs; in the apoſtacy, keeping people from the light. And one of the falſe prophets ravened from the ſpirit, which Chriſt ſaid ſhould come, <hi>John</hi> ſaw was come, and the world goes after you, that tells people the letter is the word, and the ſpirit is in the Scriptures, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture, and them that ſpoke it forth, which ſaid the ſpirit of God was within them.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt is within except ye be reprobates; yea I ſay within all Profeſſors is Chriſt, in Chriſtendom, Chriſt is within them all, except they be reprobates. And if Chriſt be not within them all, they are all reprobates, but if Chriſt be within them all, the body is dead, and there is Chriſts reign, and his Kingdom, and no <hi>Babylon,</hi> nor Antichriſt where this is ſo. And the Kingdom of Heaven is within you ſaith Chriſt, yea in the Phariſees: and that is the Kingdom in man that never conſents to ſin; like a grain of muſtard-ſeed, like unto leaven, that leavens the new lump. And he that cometh to know that little Kingdom, and receiveth that little Kingdom as a little child, it makes the Kingdoms of the world become the Son of Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and knowes that no unrighteouſneſſe, nor ungodlineſſe muſt enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>

And he ſaid be not you of men called maſter for ye have all one maſter, even Chriſt; and ye are all Brethren, this was Chriſts Command. But all ye Paſtors, and Miniſters <hi>(Bourn)</hi> and the reſt who are apoſtatized from the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Chriſts Doctrine, ye trample upon the Commands of Chriſt. It manifeſts that ye have the form of godlineſs, and denyes the power: and are not Brethren paſt from death, to life but are all on heapes about the Scriptures, Chriſts, Prophets, and Apoſtles words; and making a trade of them for your own ſelf-ends in the Apoſtacy; ſuch as Chriſt ſaid ſhould come, which <hi>John</hi> ſaw was come; which ſhould inwardly raven, which the world is gone after, But now with that which ye all ravened from are ye all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. And Chriſt ſaith call no man father upon earth, where Chriſt is witneſſed, the ſeed of God raiſed up, no earthly man is his father, nor cannot call no man fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the earth, according to the Command of Chriſt, he that is heire of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the world that hath no end; of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> born not by the will of man: but he that is of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is in another ſtate, and ſtands againſt Chriſts doctrine, and is the Son of <hi>Adam</hi> in the fall.</p>

Now he that receiveth the honour is out of the light, in the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> is out of the power. And where humility is, which goes before the honour, there is no want of honour; for he cometh into the power that maketh him honourable in the hearts of all people, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the humble principle in every one; a terrour to the evil doer; and here Magiſtrates that fears God, attain the honour that is without the reſpect of Perſons in the humility anſwering with the higher power the juſt principle in every man: ſo come they to be honoured in the hearts of all people in the ſight of God, and a praiſe of them that do well, which he that reſpects perſons, tranſgreſſeth the Law, and commits ſin; and is convinced of the Law as a trangreſſor, he that reſpects perſons is out of the faith of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt which purifies the heart, which is held in the pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and gives victory over the world; which who are of faith are of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>

And Chriſt is come now, who treads the wine-preſſe alone without the City, though all the Beaſts and falſe prophets and Antichriſts upon the earth riſe againſt him, yet the Lamb and the Saints ſhall have the victory, and the Nations ſhall be ruled with a rod of iron, and he that was dead, is alive

                  <hi>Pr. THey have ſought Gods direction out of the Scriptures which they call his holy word, and what is the greatneſs of their work, and edification and ſalvation of ſouls,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And do humbly bewail our too great neglect, who have not frequently, and earneſtly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in ſo great a work: and eſpecially that we have done no more in Catechiſing, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally inſtructing,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was the Miniſters work before the Apoſtacy to go from houſe, and warn all both ſmall and great, yea with tears; this was the work of the Miniſtry in the Spirit; And they was in the ſpirit that gave forth Scriptures: and ſo brought people into the life that gave it forth, with which they was able to inſtruct one another, and to ſtir up the pure in one another. And the work of the Apoſtles, the Miniſters of the Goſpel and Chriſt was to bring people into the life that gave forth Scriptures, and into the ſubſtance Chriſt Jeſus that the Scriptures teſtified of; But you who are fain to ſeek in the letter for it, in the Scripture for it; and have it not from within, as they had that gave forth the Scripture and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it of God: ye are never like to beget to God; And when truth comes, as it did among the Phariſees, which came to end their forms, and their ſhadowes, the builders ſtood up, and rejected it in their forms. And now ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, ſuch as have had the Scriptures, but inwardly ravened from the Spirit of God, are ſtanding againſt the light Chriſt Jeſus that doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world; And ſo ye may get people into a form, and cover them with ſheepes cloathing. Now Chriſt is come, Reignes and Rules, his Saints with him, all riſe up in armes againſt him, Kings of the earth, beaſt, and falſe prophets, the Dragon and his Angels; but the Lamb and the Saints ſhall have the victory, <hi>glory to the higheſt.</hi> And ſo that is but the blind zeal that is ſtirred up in the Apoſtates, againſt Chriſt in this age, as it was in the <hi>Jewes</hi> againſt Chriſt in their age. But <hi>Jewes</hi> muſt come to that which they cloſed their eyes, and ſtopt their ears againſt, and the Apoſtates muſt come to that which they ravened from, before they be ſtirred up in the pure zeal.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> How can men that are ignorant, and unskilful, (and the old men are yet fooliſh) and your unfitneſs do good for the ſalvation of men, when that the old men are ſo ignorant, yea, more then the young? But it is the publike maintenance that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables you, which did not enable the Apoſtles; And that is the thing which you in the Apoſtacy have looked at; For take away that from you, and pluck down your Schools and Colledges: we ſhould have but a few Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> among you; a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructers. So theſe are all made by men, ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles in the Apoſtacy, and teaching for filthy lucre, and the love of money which he ought not, diſapproved of by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy.</hi> And take away but your publike maintenance, and few of you would be able to Preach the Goſpel freely; if this tryal, and proof was among you, to prove you, it would be found that your God was your belly, and him it was ye ſerved; and him it is that means, helpes; and enables; which Chriſt and God was the enabler of his Miniſters, and Prophets, and Apoſtles; whom the earth was his, and they truſted in him: in Chriſt by whom all things was made, that was made and Created.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thus you have ſpoken to your ſhame and it is manifeſt that here is like people, like Prieſt, that ſhewes ye have not profited them at all: and it ſhewes that the Apoſtles words are fulfilled among you, the doctrines of men, the commandments of men, they periſh in the uſing of them; And who are greater in the world in ſtriving for the earth for maintenance, for Tythes, caſting into priſon, hailing before Courts, and Seſſions, then you that have called your ſelves Paſtors, and Miniſters of the Goſpel, which your fruits have declared to all the Nation? and ſo unlike the Miniſters of Chriſt, as your hearers are unlike Chriſtians (by your own relation) without reproving one another, which the Apoſtle reproved them that taught for filthy lucre: Chriſt reproved them that were called of men maſter, and reproved them that taught for money, and for meanes, and thoſe that minded earthly things, But how can ye reprove theſe things and live in the things your ſelves, one to reprove another, and be in the ſame thing himſelf; this will ſtinck among all ſober men, and ſet you all on heapes among one another, as ye are. So how can ye, or they know any thing of the foundamentals of Religion, or ſalvation, or your people either? that deny the light that doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world. Chriſt Jeſus the foundation of God, the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, the end of the Prophets, and the Law, types, figures, and ſhadowes; ye have denyed the very key that opens to it. Therefore ye all come ſhort of the glory of God: and Teachers, and people are all fallen into ignorance; ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles in the Apoſtacy: but now Chriſt is come, and coming to reign.</p>

               <p>

Repent: the Judgement of the great whore is come. The Magiſtrates begin to ſee you, and you ſhall not ride upon them. And your ignorance and all your hearers, you may well cry out of them, Repent, and come to the light which Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightened every one withall that comes into the world, to give you the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt Jeſus, out of the ignorance: which none cometh to the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but who comes to the light that ſhines in their hearts (yea in darkneſs) Chriſt hath enlightened them withall; Where it ſhineth out of darkneſs, it gives them the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

                  <hi>Pr.</hi> They ſay, <hi>Alas that any reaſonable ſoul ſhould be ſo bruitiſh, moſt of their lives is ſpent in ignorance, and worldlineſs, living in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. Page 24.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here is the fruits of your Miniſtry. Are not ye aſhamed to manifeſt your fruits thus now to the whole Nation? Is this like a vineyard, that your people that you have taken maintenance of, and the Magiſtrates, that they ſhould give you maintenance all this time, and your people ſpend moſt of their lives, in ignorance, worldlineſs, and the fleſh? Is this like the fruits of the Miniſters of Chriſt, or the fruits of the falſe prophets, that have not profited the people at all? Did not the Apoſtles keep them from them that bewitched them, and would have brought them into the fleſh. And miniſtred to the ſpirit, got out the wheat, and the corn. And are not you aſhamed to publiſh ſuch a thing to the Nation, you 58. Miniſters. To ſay a reaſonable ſoul ſhould be ſo bruitiſh? can that which is reaſonable be brutiſh? that which is bruitiſh Warrs againſt the ſoul. But this is but to diſcover your Miniſtry, and what ye miniſter to, and that the ſoul ye are ignorant of it.</p>

                  <hi>Pr.</hi> They ſay, <hi>Is it not pity that God ſhould have any reaſonable Creature that knowes not his maker, or his Lawes, or his own happineſs? Is it not pity, that after all that Chriſt hath done, and ſuffered for the world, that any that calls themſelves Diſciples, ſhould ſo little know him, and the ſalvation, and ſhould ſet ſo light by him.</hi> Pag. 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this you all Paſtors and Teachers have ſhewed your work; what doth not the creatures yet know their Maker? what are they heathen yet? what do not the creature yet know Gods Lawes? what worſe then the <hi>Jewes,</hi> heathen, and them that call themſelves the diſciples of Chriſt, and Chriſtians ſo little know him, after Chriſt hath ſuffered for them? what hath been your work all this while, what have ye been doing, what have ye had wages for, that they ſo little know him that hath ſuffered for them, and their ſalvation? and ſhould ſet ſo light by him how can they prize him, or ſee any light from Chriſt, when ye keep them from the light which doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world? which none ſeeth ſalvation but with it; and by it; and none ſeeth Chriſt that ſuffered, but with it, and by it: and none cometh to ſee, and know Chriſts end, and the end of Gods Law, and prize him, and ſet much by him, but by the light. And doth not reaſonable creatures know the Law of God? Are not reaſonable creatures in the faith? are not the unreaſonable out of the faith now that knowes not their Maker, nor his Law, nor little of the ſuffering of Chriſt, or their own happineſs, and little know their ſalvation, and ſet light by Chriſt? Are not all theſe your fruits? Are not all theſe your hearers, that ye complain of to the Nation? Have not ye now diſcovered your ſelves in this that have the form of godlineſs, but denyes the power? that keepes people alwayes learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth? But ſuch as be led away by with diverſe luſts and laden with ſins. And now are ye complaining that your people ſerves the luſt of the fleſh, and the earth, not knowing their Maker, nor knowing his Lawes, nor their ſalvation, and ſetting light by Chriſt: this ye may complain of with ſhame, who are ſuch as crept into houſes before the Apoſtles deceaſe, and ſince ye have gone over the world; But now ye are diſcovered with that which gives to ſee the end of the Apoſtacy and Apoſtates, which gives to ſee before the world was made.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God gave the ſpirit before he gave forth Scriptures: And the Devill and wicked men may get Scriptures, but they have not the ſpirit, nor none have it, but as they come to feel it given from God, as it was given to them that gave forth Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And ſo people are to finde the ſpirit of the Father ſpeaking in them, as it did in them that gave forth Scriptures, then the ſpirit anſwers to the ſpirit that gave forth Scriptures; then there is an unity with the words, and with God of whom they learned; which many may have the Bible, and not know the ſpirit that ſpoke it forth, but be erred from it: And the Scriptures are the words of God, of truth, <hi>God ſpake all theſe words.</hi> He that adds to theſe words, the words of God is pure. Chriſt is the Word, <hi>his name is called the Word of God,</hi> who was before the words were ſpoken forth, who comes <hi>in the volume of the Booke</hi> to fulfill the words: And the ſpirit was before the Scripture was given forth; for it led them to ſpeak it all forth, the words of God, as they had learned of God: So the ſpirit comes not by the <hi>Letter,</hi> but the <hi>Letter</hi> comes forth from the ſpirit. And many had the Scriptures, and knew not the Revelation, and judged the Revelation of the Son of God, and judged Chriſt who was come, the end of the viſion, which was for an appointed time. So therein thou haſt concluded thy ſelfe to be among them that have the Scriptures, and ſets up that beyond the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Son of God, which is the end of Scriptures; <hi>which none knows the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

And all they that have the Scriptures, and not the ſpirit that gave them forth, they are on heaps about words, and wants the rule. And the Covenant of grace, which is the end of the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is witneſſed and ſtabliſhed, and cannot be aboliſhed, which ends the decaying Covenant. And as for aboliſhing the Covenant of grace, thou doſt not know what thou ſpeaks of. And the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>the deep things of God was revealed by the ſpirit of God;</hi> &amp; no one knows the Scriptures and the things of God, but as God unto them doth reveal by his ſpirit; which in this thou haſt ſhewed thy ignorance of that ſpirit guided the Saints to God the Father of ſpirits, <hi>which revealed unto them the deep things of God,</hi> with which ſpirit again the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are known. And the ſpirit which always rules the Saints, and guides them up to God, and to ſpeak forth the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> They did not deny the Saints words ſpoken before them, but was in unity with them in the ſpirit, and ſo came to the <hi>ſpirits of juſt men;</hi> which none doth but who are come into the Saints rule that gave forth <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And ſo people have had the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ravened from the ſpirit, thou and the reſt of thy fellows, and have been all on heaps about words, and ſo voyd of the revelation that they were in that gave forth <hi>Scriptures.</hi> For all are unlearned upon the earth that are not in the immediate inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they were in that gave forth the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and in the tongue of the unlearned, like the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Sea.</p>

And the woman (the <hi>Evah</hi>) muſt be ſilent, for ſhe was firſt deceived; and the woman <hi>Jezebel,</hi> that calls her ſelfe a Propheteſſe, that muſt not be ſuffered to teach, or to uſurp authority; But Chriſt in the male, and Chriſt in the female, is beyond the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Evah,</hi> or ſhe that calls her ſelfe a Propheteſſe, or the great whore that reigns over the Kings of the earth, there is all their languages under: Chriſt in the Females ſhall comprehend this as well as in the Male, and give judgement, and the daughters ſhall prophecy as well as the ſons.

The Apoſtles ſhewed the fulfilling of the Scriptures, that Chriſt was come, and the Apoſtles ſaw what Chriſt ſaid ſhould come, which inwardly ravened, went forth from them, which the world hath gone after; which now we, with the ſame ſpirit the Apoſtles was in, which you all ravened from, do ſee ye, and what hath reigned

And the light was in the Apoſtles heart that ſhined, and the ſure word of propheſie that did let ſee, and foreſee, was in the hearts of people which led them to give forth Scriptures, and that which fulfills the Scriptures, the propheſie, is of Chriſt, who ends it; and the ſpirit led them to ſpeak it forth, the ſpirit of propheſie: which many may have the Scriptures, and not have the more ſure word of propheſie; And many may have the Scriptures as the Phariſees had, and ſtand againſt the Revelation of the Son of God from heaven, which is ſurer, for he was before Scripture was, who ends the Scriptures. for many may have Scriptures and be out of the life, and not know him, the Revelation of the Son of God; as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did not, and ſo ſay the Scriptures is more ſure then Revelation from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo more ſure then the Son of God who is greater then all; and the Scripture was given forth by Revelation, and none knowes it but by Revelation.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I am the light of the world, and doth enlighten every man that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world ſaith Chriſt the life. So the light which every man that cometh into the world is enlightned withall, wil let them ſee the life which it cometh from, will let them ſee their ſalvation Chriſt Jeſus, will let them ſee their Mediator, will let them ſee the truth, for the light is truth, which cometh from Chriſt the truth. And the light is Chriſt the way, the truth, the life that enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world. In him was life, and the life was the light of men, in him by whom the world was made, which light was before any natural lights was; the Sun, Moon and Stars are natural lights; and theſe was made by Chriſt the light, who doth enlighten every man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which men having a light from him by whom the world was made, by whom all things was created, who was afore any things was created, Lets them ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any created light, natural light, made lights, which gives every one the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of life: which lets every one ſee the ſalvation to the ends of the earth; which lets every one ſee the Covenant of God that love it, and believe in it, they come to the life Chriſt, him from whence the light cometh. The light is of the immortal ſeed of Chriſt Jeſus, one with the Saints light, the Saints believe in that the world hates, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that which the world hates: ſo it is the worlds condemnation: it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of them that hate it. And ſo was he promiſed a Covenant to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> aſwell as to the <hi>Jewes</hi> and ſo doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Johns</hi> witneſs and teſtimony, to the Prieſts, and <hi>Levites</hi> which came from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to examine him.

So the light is one with the Saints light, that condemnes the unbelievers. And the light which every man that cometh into the world is enlightened withall; that through it he might believe, and who believes in it, and receives it, he hath the light of life, and they become the Sons of God; and who hate it, it is their condemnation: and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96882:94"/> they are againſt Scriptures, but the light is not againſt Scriptures, but ownes them. And ſo the light is not ſo low as ye eſteem it, for it was before any thing was made or created: as for the word <hi>Trinity,</hi> there is no Scripture for it: without ye finde it in the Common-prayer Book. And the light in the converted ſhines out of Darkneſs in their hearts, and gives them the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the light in the unconverted ſhines in the Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendes it not.</p>

And they that ſpeak ſo much of Chriſt from the letter, which gives not life becauſe it ſpeakes of him; and are from the light within them which cometh from Chriſt which doth enlighten every man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſpeak as the Devil doth; and the Phariſees preaching a Chriſt is come, as they did he was to come and ſtood againſt the light that doth enligthen every man that cometh into the world; and ſent their Prieſts, and <hi>Levites</hi> to examine <hi>John,</hi> as they do now who be profeſſors, and Prieſts.

                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Bread and Wine are ſpirituall Inſtitutions, and is not carnall in a ſenſe as ſet in oppoſition to ſpiritual Inſtitution: and that is not meer carnal bread and wine after Chriſts institution to be uſed, nor an ordinary bread and wine.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>In the Lords Supper is Chriſts body, and it is his blood.</hi> page 188. <hi>And this is my body and blood, the word of a Command, do this.</hi> page 191. <hi>And Chriſt fed not the ſoules with wheat bread, and red wine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By all this what differ ye from the Papiſts? have not ye laid their foundation, and layd their ground? Bread and wine, is but bread and wine, a temporall thing, a thing ſeen, and may turn to aſhes; but the body and blood of Chriſt will not do ſo. And the bread is not ſpirituall, and the wine is not ſpirituall, but is a thing ſeen, and viſible. And who eats the fleſh of Chriſt, and drinks his blood, <hi>hungers no more, and thirſts no more;</hi> but who eats temporall bread and wine, <hi>hungers more, and thirſts more.</hi> And Chriſt did ſay, <hi>as often as ye do eat this bread, &amp; drink this cup, ye ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> And that which the Apoſtle had received of the Lord, he delivered to the <hi>Corinthians: As often as they eate that, and dranke that, they were to do it in remembrance of him, ſhewing the Lords death till he come.</hi> But then ſaith the ſame Apoſtle to the ſame <hi>Corinthians</hi> in his laſt Epiſtle; <hi>Examine your ſelves. Know you not that Chriſt is in you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye be reprobates?</hi> And ſaid, <hi>while we looke not at the things which are ſeen; for the things that are ſeen are temporall:</hi> So bread and wine are things that are ſeen, are things temporall, <hi>but the things that are not ſeen are eternall.</hi> Now bread and wine is but bread and wine, not ſpiritual after conſecration, it is but the ſame bread as it was before; and it is no nearer the body of Chriſt after they have conſecrated it, then it was before. Who is in the life and power of God, that gives every creature its being, and cauſeth every creature to come forth, is in the life and vertue of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the being of all creatures, and the wiſdome of all the Creation, that is ſpiritual: He giveth every creature its being, and cauſeth every creature to come forth, and gives the ſenſe and feeling of all creatures that is ſpirituall. And there comes up the ſoule to be known, and the ſeed CHRIST, his body, and his blood.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> All who are converted, are brought into the mediate, and converted with the immediate: there is none converted upon the earth, but it is with the immediate Spirit of God that mortifies. And all Miniſtry that is ſent of God, and from God, and called of God, where that ſpeakes to them, it is immediate, for whoſoever hears his voyce, it is immediate and powerfull. And all Miniſtry of man, ſent out by man (which is mediate) never converts any ſouls to God, for the ſoul is immediate, and mediate reacheth not to the immortal ſoul; but the immediate Miniſtry reacheth to the immediate immortal ſoul, and ſo Preacheth the immediate Goſpel to it the power of God. And all Miniſters that are ſent forth in the power of God; who are moved of God to ſpeak to any by the power of God, and the eternal Spirit of God, by the Holy-Ghoſt, that is immediate, and not of man, and that begets unto God, and converts them; that is immediate, not mediate, and they do as the power of God moves them which is immediate, and that is for God in that place. And they ſhall feel the Spirit of God in them witneſſing with that power, and the Spirit of God in another that ſpeakes to them. And the power of God is eternal, where it moves it is one, and the ſpirit of the Prophets, ſubject to Prophets. And all you ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles that do not not pretend to ſuch a call as the Apoſtles had, and to be ſuch officers as the Apoſtles in every Church; which we do believe you have not: you have ſhewed that the Holy-Ghoſt hath not made you overſeers; And you have declared your ſelves to the world to be ſuch as inwardly ravened from the ſpirit of God: and all to be but Miniſters of the letter, not of the ſpirit, and ſo onely have the ſheepes cloathing; So ye are ſuch as have brought people, and Nations to be all on heapes, and like waters: not made overſeers, as the Apoſtles was, not having the call as the Apoſtles had, ſo not by the Holy-Ghoſt, as the overſeers was by, not in the immediate power of God, as the Apoſtles was called withall, and was in; and ſo not Preachers of the Goſpel as the Apoſtles was, who was immediate, therefore theſe things have been wanting, the Holy-Ghoſt to make you overſeers, and the ſpirit the Apoſtles was in, which would cool and quiet all the ſpirits of the people. For want of this are ye all on heapes about Scriptures; But the Holy-Ghoſt opens it again to overſeers. And ſo ye that have ravened from the ſpirit of God inwardly, there is no talk among you to have the call as the Apoſtles had, and to be overſeers (as they were) over your Churches that we do believe, your fruits declares it. But the ſpirit it is witneſſed which the Apoſtles was in, which hath diſcovered you and your Church glory, be to the Lord God for ever.</p>

And ſuch as have turned the grace of God into wantonneſs, and walketh diſpitefully againſt the ſpirit of grace, and ſet up a heap of teachers after their own luſts, they are gone from the immediate grace of God that brings ſalvation. And all the teachings of God in the leaſt degree, is immediate, which brings them to open Parables, ſpeak forth Parables to the nature that is a top of the witneſs, that ſpirit is immediate, though they take a mediate Parable or compariſon, yet that ſpirit is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate that gives them to underſtand the Parable aright. And the gift that was in <hi>Timothy</hi> that he was not to neglect, was immediate, whereby he came to diſcern on whom he was to lay on his hands, and on whom he was not, ſuddainly to lay upon any man, that was immediate. And that which brought <hi>Daniel</hi> to underſtand by writings in books was immediate; and that which brings to underſtand the Scriptures is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate.

And we do believe thee, and you all, who are Apoſtatized from the Apoſtles Doctrine, in the Apoſtacy, ravened inwardly from the ſpirit of God, ye are yet to learn the immediate teaching. So are the Antichriſts ſtanding againſt the light which Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightened every one withall that cometh into the world, the Covenant of God in the heart with which all people ſhall come to know the Lord, and be taught of God, that they need not ſay know the Lord.</p>

And them that have not the ſpirit in them, that was in them that gave it forth, and are diſobedient to that, are them that ſay the ſpirit is in the letter. And ſuch ſay that the teachings immediate is jangling, that be from the ſpirit that is immediate, ravened from it in their own particulars, ſuch are never like to beget to God: but are the Miniſters of the letter, not of the ſpirit; and by that which the Devil, and they are out of, are they comprehended who be in the jangling, and in the lie.</p>

And ſo the words themſelves there gives not life to that, but as the words is raiſed up within; as it was in them that gave it forth: and that is it which gives life, and that ſees the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the fulfilling of them; and then that knows the <hi>Scriptures</hi> that cannot be broken, and in that the words ends, the word Chriſt: And that's it that gives life to all people, and ſaves the ſoule, which the Letter doth not, as it is in it ſelfe, without one have that which gave it forth, and that is not dead. And a believer, the author of his Faith is Chriſt, and the giver of it: And if he have all that is written, and be not in the light Chriſt, who is the author of his Faith, he wants the foundation of God that ſtands ſure, Chriſt Jeſus, that all the Fathers and holy men of God reſt in, in the faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any <hi>Scripture</hi> was written, in him ſtood their faith, the foundation of God, <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> glory, <hi>the light of the Gentiles,</hi> this is that which fulfills all <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and ends the faith, the ſalvation. And the Miniſters of the Word that comes to fulfil the words, thoſe Miniſters of the Word, they took in hand to ſet forth in order a Declaration of the things wrought among them, which had a perfect underſtanding from the very firſt, <hi>of what Chriſt both ſaid and did:</hi> And ſo this Declaration was given forth to be read, believed, fulfilled, and people to enjoy the thing it ſpeaks of, that which the Apoſtles preached to <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the new Covenant, the one offering, the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, him the end of the firſt Prieſthood, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw, and <hi>David</hi> ſaw, and <hi>Moſes</hi> had the type of, the Prophets wrote of. Now who enjoyes him that theſe all ſpoke of, ſaw, and preached, they have the end, the comfort of the Scriptures. And here is the Declaration ſeen, and known; and here is the ſubſtance poſſeſt, and here is the words of God, and here is the Word of God that fulfills the words, which word was before the words, in which word the words end, and are all ſum'd up into.</p>

And the <hi>light which doth enlighten every one,</hi> &amp;c. is the end of the Law, and all ſhimmering lights, and it is the light of the Goſpel. And none knows the Goſpel, the power of God, Chriſt Jeſus, but with the light that cometh from him. And here cometh every man into his particular comfort; And that is the voyce of the unbeliever like the Phariſees, that thought to have had life in the Letter, and would not come to Chriſt the life, the ſubſtance of Scriptures, but ſtops his eare to the light of God in him.</p>

Now they feel not the comfort, nor the benefit, but by the faith of Chriſt Jeſus, the one offering, in which God is pleaſed withall, which is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is Chriſts offering, his ſacrifice, his fleſh, his blood, his life, his mind muſt be manifeſt, and received within, before they come to <hi>Juſtification, Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> and the ſerving of God in the new life. <hi>And herein is God glorified, to believe in the onely begotten Son of God;</hi> and here they honour the Son in believing in him <hi>whom the Father hath ſent.</hi> And ſo they that feele not Chirſt in them, are Reprobates.</p>

And where the power of God is ſet, the Croſſe of Chriſt is felt: for the Croſſe is the power of God. And if it be not the ſame Chriſt as did aſcend, it is Antichriſt, it is againſt him, and falſe: which now many hundreds, and thouſands do witneſs Chriſt within, him the Apoſtles preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; who have their Joy, and reward; who do poſſeſſe that which they long looked for.

And all that be in the Faith as <hi>Timothy</hi> was, they be in the immediate Revelations, the gift of God. But the Apoſtle ſeeing ſuch as would not endure ſound doctrine, would get up teachers after their own luſts, as covetous, and minded earthly things, and evil beaſts, that ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt but their own bellies. Such the Apoſtle bid <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> examine before they Miniſtred, prove them, and lay hands on no man ſuddainly and keep himſelf clear, not preferring one before another. And ſuch as went into their own luſts got up heaps of teachers; loſt the immediate Revelation, and the immediate word of God, and erred from the faith that purifies the heart and gives victory: in which people have unity.

And them that eat not his fleſh, and drink not his blood, have no life in them: and they that eat his fleſh, have his fleſh in them. And the Saints are not diſtinct from him, for they ſate with him in heavenly places, and he is in them, and they in him; And Chriſt in you the myſtery, the hope of glory, and he is the head of the Church, and ſo not diſtinct.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God is a ſpirit, and he dwells in his Saints, and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him; In him we live, and move, and have our being, who is in all, and through all, and over all, God bleſſed for ever. And the ſpirit of the Father ſpeakes in the Saints, and he makes his abode with them; And the Saints have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Father, and the Son, ſo not diſtinct; ſo theſe keep people from unity with God, and out of his knowledge, which the knowledge of God ſhall come to cover the earth, as the waters cover the Sea. And while any are ſeparated from the Lord it is their miſery; and diſtinct from him they are from the Spirit of God in their own particulars, and are not Saints; But ſuch as come to walk in the ſpirit, they have fellow-ſhip with him, and lives in his preſence, and ſeeth his face, and behold his glory, and ſtands in his Councell, and hears inſtruction, and they are one; he that ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and they that are ſanctified are all of one. And ſo God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, though ſin and iniquity had ſeparated, who breakes down iniquities bonds, and brings light, life and immortality to the light, through the power which is the Goſpel, whereby fellowſhip and unity comes with God, and not diſtinct, and his bleſſing and bleſſedneſſe felt; for they that have unity with God, they have unity with his bleſſing, and they that have fellowſhip with God know his bleſſedneſs.</p>

But they being from the light, and out of the light which Chriſt hath enlightened them withall, they are out of the truth as the Devil is.

And all upon the earth that can talk of a righteouſneſs without them, and ſanctification, and juſtification without them, and a Chriſt without them, and not within them, they are reprobates; for Chriſt is the righteouſneſs of God, and the ſanctification and the juſtification of man from the Law, and its works, who ſtands between God, and man. So he is the redemption, who Redeemes man out of the fall, which he fell into; and he doth ſanctifie him, and he doth juſtifie him, and this is all found within: and this not being, found within, he is reprobate. And ſo none are ſaved but who witneſſeth this within. They have the letter, (the wolves,) the ſheepes cloathing, the ravenors inwardly from the Spirit of God, and thoſe are them that denyes it within.</p>

So ſome forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of meats, and forbiding to marry, whoſe conſciences are feared as with a hot iron. The Devils Doctrine, ſpeaking lies in hypocriſie, and giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits, you are the ſpirits that inwardly ravened from the Spirit of God, that deny im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation, and hearing the voice of God immediately, theſe are the ſeducing ſpirits, and keepes all people in the burning and heating luſts, from the marriage of the Lamb, all the ſeducing ſpirits doth that deny Revelation, immediate inſpiration, hearing the voyce of God immediately from heaven now as ever.

So ye have got up your Church which was a Maſſ-houſe and Tythes, and ſprinkling Infants who have had the time of compelling others to worſhip.

And is it your mouth now to your Magiſtrates in the Apoſtacy ſince the dayes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles?

But thy fruits hath ſtunck about thee, and your fruits; how Barbarouſly the Saints have been uſed among you, (and true Chriſtians in the ſpirit) and ſo them that make War againſt the Saints, are ſuch that inwardly ravened from the ſpirit, and ſo got the ſheepes cloathing, and turned againſt them that had the Spirit of God: ravened from the Spirit of God inwardly, loſt the ſpiritual weapons, and had onely the ſheepes cloathing, and that would not carry them out in the time of need, and ſo was fain to flie to Magiſtrates, to the carnal weapons: and ſo by this means in all ages the righteous have been ſlain by them that had the Scriptures; but from the ſpirit that gave them forth, and all the Saints upon the earth have been ſlain by them that have been from that of God in their own particulars, which now that is awakened by which men come to be turned unto God. And ſo you now that do deny the light that doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world, that preach, men ſhould have ſin while they be upon earth, and the body of it, and imperfection are ſuch as have led people captive all their life times, with the form of godlineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the power; And keepes people in ſpiritual <hi>Egypt, Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> in filthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and darkneſs, where Chriſt was crucified by them whoſe ears were ſtopt to that of God in them, and that was ſpiritual <hi>Egypt.</hi> And ſo are all you that be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ravened from the Spirit of God in your own particulars: yet having a form of godlineſs, denying the power, you are from that of God ravened inwardly.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is your own condition, and the Papiſts, who cannot own the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as they ſpeak; but you will make the <hi>Scriptures</hi> bend to your own wills, and wreſts them as the Phariſees did, and as you and the Papiſts do Chriſts words, who ſayes, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> and you ſay <hi>ſwear.</hi> How now, <hi>Edward Bouls,</hi> who makes the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> bend now? Thou teaches men ſhould ſwear, and Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſwear at all,</hi> and ſo art an Antichriſt, and againſt the Doctrine of Chriſt, and teacheſt thy own tradition for doctrine, and makes the commandement of Chriſt of none effect.

               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> Thou ſayes, <hi>Chriſt came not to deſtroy the Law; and it hath deceived ſome to ſay,</hi> Swear not at all. <hi>The Scriptures muſt not be taken in generall termes; for</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all things to all men: And Chriſt, and our Saviour his intent is this, that we ſhould not ſwear as we were wont to do, for the word Generall,</hi> not at all <hi>must be interpreted: ſo that you ſee it is the ſcope and circumſtance of this place, that this</hi> Swear not at all <hi>be interpreted, vain and unneceſſary cuſtomes, and abuſe of ſwearing among the Jewes: and it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to ſwear, but to all men not onely a liberty, but in juſt caſes a duty of ſwearing, and part of divine worſhip, not Ceremoniall or Mutable, there's no ſhadow or type in it. An Oath is for confirmation and the end of ſtrife, it gives the laſt peale to all differences, and gives a great honour to God, and is the proper end of worſhip, and conſequently a great honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are deceived that breaks Chriſts commands; for when he ſays, <hi>ſwear not at all.</hi> He ſayes, in all your communication <hi>let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, for whatſoever is contrary is evill.</hi> So he layeth down no other Doctrine that men ſhould practice then <hi>not to ſwear at all,</hi> but <hi>yea, yea, and nay, nay,</hi> them that goes any further, go into the evill; <hi>whatſoever is more is evill.</hi> So minde theſe 3 things, and the Apoſtle becoming all to all men, yet not without the Law of Chriſt [Mark] the Law Chriſt, which was <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> ſo ſtill that's agreeable to Chriſts words; the <hi>Scripture</hi> is taken generall, and Chriſt ſaid, <hi>It hath been ſaid to them of old time, thou ſhalt performe the oath of the Lord.</hi> Chriſt ſaid ſo, that comprehended time that was the end of that old time where had been the ſwearing; But I ſay unto you now, <hi>Sweare not at all;</hi> and ſo it was not the frivolous oaths that was among the <hi>Jewes</hi> that ſwore, but it was true oaths that Chriſt brought them off, the oath that was to be performed to the Lord, which Chriſt the oath of God ended, who comprehends time, and told
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96882:106"/> them the danger, if they went any farther then yea and nay: And ſo your interpreting the Scripture, which are the private Interpreters, is but to wreſt them to your own earthly wills; and that which oppoſeth the commands and doctrine of Chriſt, brings not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God, is not a part of his worſhip, nor is not divine, but in that which is out of truth (for none worſhips God but who is in Chriſt, who ſayes, <hi>ſweare not at all,</hi> who is the end of the Law and the Prophets, and Oaths) and is but one of your dark conſequences, and ſo it is not mens duty in any caſe to ſwear; for the duty of man is to keep the commands of Chriſt, and there is none that is juſt that will ſwear, that obeys the commands of Chriſt; but ſuch ſwears who are unjuſt, and they be out of that which gives the laſt peale, and ends all differences, which ends all oaths, and all ſtrife, and all controverſie, which is Chriſt Jeſus the covenant of God; for ſtrifes, controverſies, and differences is without the covenant of Light and Life, Chriſt Jeſus, the oath of God; and ſo thou art not a Miniſter of Chriſt, that brings people back to the Law, and tells them it is lawfull to ſweare: Here the Papiſts and thee art one, both oppoſing the commands of Chriſt, which would make people believe it was the frivolous oaths among the <hi>Jewes</hi> that Chriſt brought them off, and not of the true oaths, and ſays it was not a ſhadow. I ſay yes, it made peace, and ended the ſtrife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, the oath of God that was ſworn by the Lord; but Chriſt the oath of God ends the ſtrife, and ends thoſe oaths that men were to ſwear by the Lord: So it was typicall and ceremoniall, and was to change, and was mutable; for Chriſt that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends time, ſayes <hi>in the old time the oath muſt be performed to the Lord;</hi> but I ſay unto you now <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> So that was to be changed, and it did type forth ſomething. There you may ſee the ſubſtance of it, Chriſt the oath of God, in which men have peace, who ends the ſtrife between men and God, who makes all things new: And ſo they that bring men to the ſwearing, bring men into the evill; And they that bring men to the Law and Prophets that ſpeaks of ſwearing, brings men from Chriſt who is the end of the Law and Prophets into the old time.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>The ground and occaſion of Oaths yet remains, and ſo a uſefulneſſe of Oaths for the ending of Controverſies, which must be establiſhed by Oaths for the ending of humane ſocieties. The Apoſtates taking for granted, that the Christian Religion did forbid all Oaths, it is falſe and ridiculous; for the Prophet ſaid,</hi> every tongue ſhall ſwear: And thou ſhalt ſwear by my name, <hi>Deut. And men verily ſwear by the greater: And men and Angels have made uſe of Oaths to confirme the truth, and avenge falſhood. I ſee not how ſwearing by any creature can be exempted from idolatry: He that ſweareth muſt do it righteouſly in a lawfull juſt matter Thoſe that ſwear falſely are highly guilty of offence against the God of truth. Can a Blackmore change his skin, or a Leopard his ſpots?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt who hath ended oaths, who ends controverſies amongſt men, and brings them to peace one with another, and with God, and ends the Law, and fulfils it, and doth not break it, and ends the Prophets who ſware, <hi>and Chriſt is the end of the Law to every one that believes;</hi> and your humane ſocieties, which be of the earth from the ground, amongſt whom is the oaths, the ſwearing, be out of the doctrine of Chriſt, and knows not the end of the Law and the Prophets, and they be the Apoſtates, and falſe, and ridiculous, apoſtatized from Chriſt and the Apoſtles doctrine, that ſwear, and teach men ſo, and are not the true Chriſtians: and ſo you that will ſwear, will forſwear, which be out of the truth; for the truth Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> And the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>above all things my brethren ſwear not at all.</hi> So you be the falſe brethren apoſtatized from the truth, and are come to be as black as the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> and the <hi>Black moors,</hi> and the cuſtome of the ſin of your ſwearing doth take away the ſenſe. And men and Angels ſwearing, and the ſwearing by the greater: <hi>And to the Lord every tongue ſhall ſwear, and performe their oaths to him;</hi> and they were to ſwear by the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt, to him the Angels muſt bow; and as the people had ſworn by <hi>Baal,</hi> ſo the Prophet brought them to ſwear by the Lord to change their forme, to ſwear by the Lord as a true oath, and perform it to him; But Chriſt the end of the Prophets and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:96882:107"/> the Law, as I ſaid before, and the true oath; for ſaith he, <hi>It hath been ſaid to them of old time, thou ſhalt performe thy oath to the Lord;</hi> that was a true oath, not a falſe oath, let all take notice of that. <hi>But I ſay unto you now, ſweare not at all:</hi> So he came to end the true oath Chriſt, the oath of God. And ſo though the Angels, or men in ſtrife, or Prophets, or <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Law ſaid ſwear: Yet Chrſt, who comprehends time before the world was made, who came to end that old time, ſayes, <hi>Sweare not at all, but yea and nay in all your communications, and whatſoever is more then theſe cometh of evill.</hi> And many men are undone by theſe falſe oaths, and by ſwearing: And you that call your ſelves Miniſters of the Goſpell, and teach men to ſwear; and Chriſt ſays <hi>ſweare not at all,</hi> have brought another Doctrine, and ſo are to be accurſed.</p>
               <p>And again, do not you ſwear by the Bible, by the Prophets, and <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; Chriſts, and the Apoſtles words? and ſwear by the Evangeliſts, and Chriſt ſays, <hi>ſwear not at all?</hi> What a perverſe generation of people, of men, are ye Profeſſors and Teachers and people? What an unchriſtian ſpirit have you? And ſee, have you not brought the judgement upon your ſelves to be the Idolaters? For the true oath was by the Lord among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and you ſwear by the Evangeliſts, and the Bible that tells you you ſhould not ſwear. Did ever the Prophets ſwear by <hi>Moſes</hi> words? or <hi>Moſes</hi> by <hi>Enochs?</hi> or the Apoſtles by the Prophets or Chriſts words? Now is not this a frivolous oath to ſwear by the Bible, which ſayes, <hi>ſweare not at all?</hi> And worſe then the <hi>Jewes</hi> that ſwore by the Temple, who was to ſwear by the Lord, and to performe the oath to him? Which that oath Chriſt ended, and brought men out of ſtrife, and the earth into peace with God to the beginning, <hi>to the glory which was with the Father before the world was began,</hi> who brings the <hi>peace on earth, and good will towards men.</hi> And do not you that ſwear by the Bible, ſwear by all thats contained in it? like as the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſwore by the Temple? and ſo hath not the Bible judged you? Here Chriſts words and the Apoſtles that tells you <hi>ye ſhould not ſweare,</hi> and yet you ſwear. And if yee ſay the Prophets, and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and the Angels ſwore, and men of Strife ſwore; Doth not Chriſt and the Apoſtle tell you he is the end of the Prophets, a greater then <hi>Solomon? David</hi> called him Lord Before <hi>Abraham</hi> was; reignes over the houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to him the Angels bow, ſayes <hi>ſweare not at all. This is my beloved Son, hear him,</hi> is the end of the Law and the Prophets to him that believes, which hears him; But it ſeems you will not hear him that are the ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and forſwearers: And the Apoſtle brings that concerning an oath is the end of controverſie among men of ſtrife; and men ſwear by the greater: Yet they ſware by the Lord, he brings the example, not that men ſhould ſwear; but ſhewing how God could not finde a greater, ſware by himſelfe concerning his Son, who is the oath of God, the end of Oaths, and the true oath that men ſwear that ends the ſtrife: He brought peace on earth, and good will towards men, that ended that oath, and brought men to unity to God, and one another, out of the Earth to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. That Oaths are to be performed if the Scriptures were ſilent: The Law of Nature and Nations would ſpeak loud in this point, becauſe of the particular miſcarriages in humane Societies: Therefore ſayes the Lord,</hi> Mine oaths ye deſpiſed, and my covenant ye have broken. <hi>It would be a great diſhonour to the nature of an Oath, if it ſhould tye any man to diſobey the commands of God. Governours are ready to thinke it their great ſecurity to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh themſelves by Oaths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The commands of Chriſt, let the Law (as ye call it) of Nature and Nations cry never ſo loud for ſwearing, who ſtabliſh themſelves by ſin and trangreſſion in the earthly humane ſocieties, the commands of Chriſt forbids ſwearing: And I know that the Law of Nations, and the Nationall Laws have ſworn by ſeverall Heathen gods and Idols, as the Jewes ſwore by the Temple, and you by the Evangeliſts; and Chriſt ſayes, <hi>ſwear not at all,</hi> and his Apoſtles. And here's great out-cries for oaths, but here is a cry from the Lord Chriſt, ſayes <hi>ſwear not at all:</hi> And oaths was in the Covenant, which Covenant was to change (mark that) Oaths deſpiſed, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96882:107"/> broken. This was the firſt covenant in which were the oaths that was to change and decay; which Chriſt came to end both Covenant and Oaths, and bid them <hi>ſwear not at all,</hi> and took away the firſt covenant, that he might eſtabliſh the ſecond. And ſo as the <hi>Jewes</hi> brake the firſt covenant, and deſpiſed the Lords oath which was to ſwear by himſelf, who is the greater, and to him to perform it: So you deſpiſe his covenant, his Son, the everlaſting covenant, that ends oaths, and the firſt covenant, that are teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to ſwear, and ſo there is ſwearing and for-ſwearing. The lamentable work and doings as you may ſee in your Courts, how they will ſwear a man hath ſo much when he hath not halfe ſo much, as the Writs and Indictments, and all their bad ſtuff declares it. And ſo you that ſwear do break the commands of Chriſt; though it was the command of God in the old time to ſwear, yet it is the command of Chriſt who makes all things new, <hi>ſwear not at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Governours that are eſtabliſhed by Oaths are out of the doctrine of Chriſt, that eſtabliſh themſelves by that which Chriſt denies, and ſo eſtabliſh themſelves out of the power, command, and authority, and doth not hear the Son, and are not the true chriſtians, but are apoſtatized from the true Church, hath onely his name, but are dead to the life.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt that takes away oaths, and ſhewed the danger of them that went into oaths, more then <hi>yea and nay in all their Communications,</hi> bid them <hi>ſwear not at all,</hi> and that they went into the evill that did, he eſtabliſhed a way; by two or three witneſſes every word is eſtabliſhed: So they that would have any more then <hi>yea and nay,</hi> may take the order of Chriſt, minde the order of Chriſt, two or three witneſſes, that yee may eſtabliſh every word: And this is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. YOung men and women having ſome convictions and awakenings of the Law, and have followed the light of an awakened conſcience, and ſit down before they have cloſed with Chriſt, and there be not a diſtinction between the righteouſneſs imputed, upon the account of the blood of Chriſt, and the righteouſneſs inherent wrought in us by his ſpirit: and this inherent righteouſneſs they confound the attainments brought forth by the Light in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, not being able to diſtinguiſh the working of Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Inherent righteouſneſſe is a word of thy own and the Papiſts inventing, and thou art a man that cannot diſtinguiſh between the workings of Chriſt, and the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Satan. For the light <hi>which every man that cometh into the world is enlightned withall,</hi> which brings men and women to know the Law, and the convictions of it, it brings them to the end of the Law, Chriſt, and to ſee that appear that cannot be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the Righteouſneſſe imputed to a believer that is within felt: <hi>For he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves hath the witneſſe in himſelfe,</hi> and feels it there; and the blood of Chriſt is felt within, juſtifying and cleanſing the conſcience from dead works: And the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Faith is found within, and that righteouſneſſe which is wrought within is found within, and no man ſees this but with the <hi>light which Chriſt hath enlightned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that cometh into the world withall,</hi> and this Light is that which confounds
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96882:108"/> all thy attainments for Chriſts righteouſneſs, and his blood and ſpirit are all one which juſtifies and ſanctifies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. They dream of a perfection to obey the light within, and this is deluſion; they are not able to diſtinguiſh, between juſtified freely by grace which is the favour of God upon the account of Chriſts ſatisfaction, and the grace that wrought by Chriſts ſpirit in the ſoul: that natural light within, being improved, they call grace the work of God upon the ſoul, leads into Covenant of works, then it is no other then to tread in the Papiſts ſteps; ſo this is deluſion, and the ground of their deluſion is their not diſtinguiſhing between ſaving light given forth by Chriſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and the light of conſcience that every man hath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> None come, to the perfection out of the deluſion, but who comes to the light within, and followes that; it gives him the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt; the <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace is one, that which was wrought without is within in the ſoul, for Chriſt in you, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and he is the <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace, of light, of life, and of peace: and none knowes him without, nor Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by grace, but who knowes it in the heart, and it is the one and the ſame thing, it is not another grace, nor another <hi>Covenant,</hi> nor another Chriſt, but the the ſame Chriſt in you: the Saints are in his ſpirit and in his mind and are of his fleſh, and of his bone; And thou who art ſo full of thy deluſions; Art out of this, and thou alwayes have been in the dreams, and never knowes perfection, till thou come to the light within. And Gods work in the ſoul leads to the end of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of works, who works all in us, and for us; as ſayes the Apoſtle, who works faith, grace, commands the light to ſhine out of darkneſs ſhines in the heart to give the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Son; and ſo thou art in the deluſion and the Papiſts doctrine, that knowes not this within, but calls it the <hi>Covenant</hi> of works, doſt not thou tread in their ſteps, and have crept up in their great Maſſe-houſes, and the light given forth by Chriſt in converſion, and the light in the conſcience is one, and it is not natural, it was before natural was, it exerciſeth the conſcience towards God, and towards man in them that love it; but in them that hate it, they are not converted, but they live in the many wayes out of the one way to God; for he thats the <hi>Covenant</hi> of light is the <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace; and thus thou art blinding people with many things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. The owning not the imputation of Chriſt as the matter and formal cauſe of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is damnable doctrine: to make our reconciliation to God to be wrought by our improving the light within, and renewing the image of God in us is damnable doctrine, to take men off from going to the fulneſs of Chriſt at the right hand of God, and ſend them to look to a light within, which they ſay is in every man, is a damnable doctrine, this is to forſake the fountain of living waters and dig to themſelves broken Ciſternes: dangerous principle is that of perfection by improvement of the light within.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The imputation to a believer is owned; and this imputation is within, for he that believes is born of God, and hath the witneſſe in himſelf; now <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to ſuch the imputation was ſpoken in the belief; and <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw his glory, who is Chriſt Jeſus the righteouſneſs it ſelf; and the Apoſtle ſayes ye are now nearer then when ye believed, and again he ſayes, Chriſt is in you, and God will dwell in you, and walk in you, ſo ſuch as hath Chriſt in them, they have the righteouſneſs it ſelf, without imputation, the end of imputation, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God it ſelf Chriſt Jeſus; No man knowes the reconciliation, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation made with God, but by hearing and doing the word of God, thats in the heart and mouth, which divides thy bad words <hi>[Hammond]</hi> and thy bad thoughts [thats the word of God] and cuts them down, and Hammers them down, and burns them up, thats the word that ſanctifies and reconciles to God, and makes clean, and the word is Chriſt, called the word of God, and Chriſt is the light that doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten every man that cometh into the world, and that is it that renews man into the image of God; for the light that comes from Chriſt is the Image of God, the light of the glorious Goſpel which is the Image of God, and ſo this is within, and thou that knowes not this within, and feels it not, thy lips are polluted, and art in the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96882:109"/> damnable doctrine, and the light that ſhines in the darkneſs, and thou cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it; and indeed thou art too proud, high and loftie, and thou muſt be brought down, the Lord God will abaſe thee; and no man comes into the image of God, and renewed, and hath reconciliation with God, but which comes to the Light which Chriſt the Word hath enlightened him withall, and thats within, and they that believe in it have the witneſs in themſelves, and they that do not, the light condemns them And the light that every man that comes into the world is enlightened withall, doth not take them from Chriſts fulneſs at the right hand of God; but the light lets ſee him lifted up, and there's none upon the earth comes to Chriſt at the right hand of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of his fulneſs, but who comes to the light which Chriſt doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world withall: thats the eye, the light with which he ſees Chriſt, and in that he receives him, and comes to be engrafted in him in the Vine Chriſt Jeſus. And ſo thou that drawes men from the light within which Chriſt hath enlightened every man that comes into the world withall, thou drawes them from Chriſt at the right hand of God, that they cannot receive this his fulneſs, and ſo thou takes away the key of knowledge from people, who art in the doctrine thats damnable, thats from the light, to be condemned; and none comes to the Fountain of living mercies, but are all broken Ciſterns, that are from the light within them, which comes from Chriſt the Fountain of living mercies which doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world, that with it all might come to ſee the Fountain and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in it, ſo they that do not are condemned; And no one knowes perfection, nor comes into the perfection of Chriſt, but are in the dangerous eſtate, where thou art which doth not come into the light which doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world; for the imperfection comes by the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and the Devil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from the truth; the perfection comes again by Chriſt to deſtroy the Devil, death and his works, and ſanctifies man and reconciles man again to God; which doth enlighten every man that comes into the world, that in the light all men might ſee the perfection of God Chriſt Jeſus; which none doth but ſuch as come to him, the Light.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. That all the light they have is but the light of a natural conſcience, and that is a blurr'd one too. Nay how comes it to paſſe that in old England we ſee ſo many hundreds, that manifeſt no other light but a natural conſcience; and New England, that have converſed with the Indians, and never ſaw the leaſt breaking forth of the light.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Anſw. The light which doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world,</hi> by whom the world was made, was before natural conſcience was, or natural light either, or the blurr'd light as thou cals it; And many of the <hi>Indians</hi> do ſhew forth more in their converſations of the light then you do; and as for old, <hi>England</hi> what have you been doing all this while, if you ſee ſo many hundreds manifeſting no other light but a natural conſcience? But how ſhould they manifeſt it, when you keep them from it: your work is to keep them from the light within; But now there's thouſands that are manifeſting the light on the houſe top, by which the world was made; which doth <hi>enlighten every man that cometh into the world;</hi> and you Miniſters of Satan out of the light and truth, are them that ſtands againſt it; for the Devil that went out of the light and truth, who ſowed his ſeed in the hearts of people: he would not have them to own the light in them; and he would confeſſe a God without him, and ſo he teaches them in whom he ſowes his ſeed not to have the light within them, the ſeed Chriſt, the tree of righteouſneſs, the root of God.</p>

The Son of man is come, and the Saints go not about to blot out the name of the Sabbath; for the pure Sabbath, the ſanctified day was a ſigne and a figure of the pure <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the ſanctification, by whom the day was made, and which day the people was to reſt, and the beaſts, which was to be ſanctified, the pure day, the pure <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was before the day, was the ſanctification in which all the Lords people have reſt, who is Lord of the Sabbath, before the day was made, fulfills the type, the ſhadow, the ſigne, the body is <hi>Christ,</hi> the head is held: So you that are running to obſerve dayes and times, are them that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, that he was afraid of, that his labours he had beſtowed in vain, and ſo gone from the body into the ſhadow and the ſigne. Neither do you keep it as you ought to do, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe a Sabbath; your Horſes and your Cattell is doing work, drawing you to your worſhips; your making fires through your Congregations, your bearing burthens, your gathering your meat on that day as you call your Sabbath.

So the reſt, the Sabbath was a ſigne of its reſt from their labours, Chriſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer, and Redeemer, and Deliverer of all the whole Creation, and bringing it to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and reconciliation again to God, who is the reſt both to man and beaſt; and the Stranger ſhould reſt within the gates of the Sabbath, within Chriſt.

               <p>And the Saints which comes to the body Chriſt, comes to honour him who ends the Sabbath which is a ſign, and a ſhadow, and ſuch honors God the Redeemer and Creator and Chriſt by whom all things was created and made, and which are the dear children of God the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, he did not bring them into dayes, and to obſerve Sabbaths, and ſignes, but brings them to the body Chriſt the Lord of the Sabbath; and doth not ſet up that which thou cals devotion; in holding up the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath, which was a ſign, on which they ſhould reſt; the reſt of the creation, and the reſt of all man kinde, cattel, and beaſts, that God would reſtore, and redeem all things by Chriſt who is the word, and gives reſt; and is the ſanctification, and gives reſt to the whole creation.</p>

               <p>And the Apoſtle was not Antichriſt that ſaid the body was Chriſt, &amp; the Sabbath was ſhadows, and brought them off of days and off of ſigns, types and ceremonies, and the firſt Prieſt-hood, firſt covenant and offerings, and brought them to the body Chriſt, that ended them all, and takes off the vayl that's upon the hearts of people while <hi>Moſes</hi> was read.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this you have ſhewed your ſpirits, and made manifeſt you are voyd of the revelation from God, and your ignorance of the Scriptures; for the holy Ghoſt ſhall not ſpeak of it ſelfe, but take of his: And the Apoſtles, what they had ſeen and heard they declared: And Chriſt, what he had received of the Father, he declared; and the ſpirit, that which ſpeaks in the Church, and it ſhews the fulfilling of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and it keeps not people long in Texts, as the world doth, that wreſts Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures up and down, and keep people in ſects; and ſo there is the ſpirit leading into all truth, and the ſpirit of the Father ſpeaking within, and the holy Ghoſt that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved men to give forth Scripture, that teacheth to divide the word aright, which is the ſpirit of prophecy in the Church, not ſtudying.</p>
               <p>Pr. They ſay, <hi>Every man that hath the ſpirit in ſome meaſure, doth not attain to the great height and degree that they did that gave forth Scriptures, that therefore may not lawfully and infallibly teach as they did.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Every man that hath a meaſure of the ſpirit of God in the leaſt meaſure or degree, it is infallible, and ſo far may they teach infallibly, and know Scriptures; but they cannot know all Scriptures, but as they attain to the full meaſure of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and to the meaſure and ſtature, and fulneſs of Chriſt: and if they do not attain to all this, they are not able to know all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and the work of the Miniſters of God was to bring people to this, to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſtature, and fulneſſe of Chriſt, and ſaith, <hi>Let every one miniſter as he hath received the grace;</hi> And take heed of any of you going beyond your meaſure, and them that deny the grace of God appearing to all men, cannot miniſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> They ſay, <hi>The greateſt part of profeſsors in the viſible Church were, and are always earthly minded, nor can rightly value ſpirituall and heavenly things.</hi>

Now to prove that you do preach for hire, where many Steeple-houſes in many Pariſhes that hath no Prieſt, thither you go not, becauſe there is but a little Benefice, and they have ſoules as well as others; and where there is agreement for ſo much a year, thither you go, is not this for hire? and ſo the Prophets words fulfil'd, <hi>the Prieſts preach for hire;</hi> and all theſe great ſums of money which has lifted you up, and gathered a great deale of it out of poor mens labours, this hath been the undoing of you all (and Nations) and many poor people

Whereas the Steeple-houſe you call your Church will ſpot, wrinkle, and blemiſh, and decay, and fall down, and wicked men may prevail againſt it; but the gates of Hell cannot prevail againſt that Church which is built upon the rock.</p>
               <p>Pr. And thou ſayſt, <hi>Thou doſt not ſpeak in that degree of the holy Ghoſt as the Prophets and Apoſtles did that ſpoke forth Scriptures.</hi>

               <p>And as for all thy lies and ſlanders thou heaps up in thy Book, they are not worth mentioning, but will come upon thy own ſelf, for they are thine own covering, which is judged, the witneſſe in thee ſhall anſwer.</p>

Perfection is not to be attained to by the life ye live, untill ye come to the principle of God in you; but the life that <hi>David</hi> lived in ſaw an end of all perfection: And all who come to Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> they come to perfection; and all who attain to him, they attain to perfection in the life of God out of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> but who deny the light <hi>that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> and reſt in the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> the life they live in, denies perfection, and never owns it in the life they live in; But who comes into perfection, comes into Chriſt a new life out of <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fall, in tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. All Phyſitians to ſick men are to make them perfect; And do yee ſay, make none whole, make none perfect, make never a man perfect? For being made whole, they are made perfect, for ſin wounds; for the Miniſtery of God was to bring people to the perfect man, <hi>to preſent them perfect.</hi> Theſe were Phyſitians of value and of worth, whereby the body, ſoule, ſpirit and all were cured, <hi>and they glorified God in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now yee that ſay they ſhall not be perfect, and that none ſhall be without ſin upon the earth, no perfection in the life we live in; Theſe are Phyſitians of no value, yee are not worthy to have the name of Phyſitians, Miniſters nor Teachers, <hi>Thomas Weld, Richard Prideaux, Samuel Hammond, William Cole,</hi> and <hi>William Durant;</hi> for yee are pleading while men be upon earth they muſt have a body of ſin, and he that ſaith otherwayes is a deceiver, and ſo ye keep them in their wounds and ſores, putrifying and imperfect, and not makers up of the breach, and binders up of the wound; And the Lord ſaith, <hi>Though their ſins be as red as crimſon, I will make them as white as wool, and will blot out ſin and tranſgreſſion.</hi> And this tender love and kindneſſe of the Lord, and mercifulneſs to ſinners &amp; tranſgreſſors, hath the Lord made manifeſt amongſt them which the world in ſcorn calls <hi>Quakers;</hi> and it is not a ſtrange thing that you would not have people to forſake the faſhions of the world, who are thus hung about with ribbons and cuffs, and ſcarfs, and your double Boot-hoſe-tops, and more like unto Stage-players then Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>Perfection is a fancy, thoſe were not words of true Phyſitians who brought men to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, to the growth up in perfection amongſt the perfect ones who ſpeak wiſdome.</hi> They ſay, <hi>It is no where ſaid that the Law is fulfilled in any Saints in this life.</hi>

And ſo all your poyſon of your Pulpits, as Satans oracles, hath been like ſuch a thing; for the Pulpiters are them which have cauſed the great perſecution and impriſoning for ſpeaking to them; and becauſe they will not give them maintenance, and ſo quenching the ſpirit, and that which quenches the ſpirit is not of God; for in the true Church all may propheſie one by one; and if any thing be revealed to him that ſits by, the other muſt hold his peace, that all may learn and be comforted. <hi>The ſpirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are ſubject to the Prophets;</hi> And this was the order in the Churches of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtles deceaſe: But ſince their deceaſe amongſt you that are apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed from them, this is diſorder, and ſets you all on an uproar and confuſion; So your Church and Pulpit is more like Satans oracle, then the Church of God; and you have been in your Pulpits more like womens ſcolding to the Cuck-ſtool, which you ſpeak of, then men that preach the Goſpel; as the Pariſhes may wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe how they have been burthened with your rayling againſt other people which have not been preſent with you: And when any of them have come to you, you have cryed take them away, they diſturb you. Is not this worſe then wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens ſcolding; for women will ſtand and ſcold one with another, but ye will ſcold behind their backs, and cannot endure to ſpeak to their faces, but cry to priſon with them.</p>
               <p>But the Rod is gone over you, and you are come under the ſcourge, the whip and the laſh for your evill words, which have corrupted your manners, when ye ſhould have been preaching the peaceable way to the Kingdome of God, ye have been bringing people to ſtrife, throwing them into priſon for ſpeaking a word to you, that cannot give you maintenance, which you do no work for. But the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſpoken in <hi>Matth.</hi> is coming upon you, ye caſt into Priſon to death becauſe they cannot give you maintenance, therefore ye are far ſhort of viſiting them which be in Priſon; And theſe covers will not cover you, and all your hard ſpeeches which you have vented forth in your Book, which is not worth mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but they will come upon your ſelves; for every one of your words ſhall be your burthen. Now fools may ſubſcribe their hands to things they know not, and go with a multitude to do evill; but wiſe men conſider and ponder the things before-hand: So all your Petitions, the holy Scriptures of the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apoſtles, read and try them, whether ye have ever an example amongſt any of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, that ever put up a Petition to any ſupream of a Nation; or that Chriſt ever gave them any ſuch command, that his Diſciples ſhould go and beg with a Petition to the ſupream powers of the Nation for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance? Have not you in this diſhonoured the Goſpell and Chriſtianity, and ſhewed that you are not of the royall Prieſt-hood, nor of the royall ſeed, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant? nor you Miniſters to them that do freely give, which have freely received? but to be ſuch whoſe ſpirits be in the earth: And you Petitioners
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96882:135"/> are not able to maintain them; which all Magiſtrates that ſtand in the fear of the Lord God will judge, and ſo ſee that you have ſhamed your ſelves, your Miniſtry and Church, and that you are not a Vineyard, that you have not a Flock to give you milke, to give you fruit, but they muſt be fain to give you fruit: And the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates muſt be fain to give your Miniſters milke, and ſo ſhewed the ſloathfulneſſe of them that have plowed, and are not made partakers of their hope, but have loſt it. In vain have they plowed and threſhed, and not got out the Corn. And in all this have not you ſhewed your idleneſs, that ye have not laboured &amp; got a Vineyard, and threſht and got no corne; and have not plowed and ſowed the ſeed? And will not the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſee you in this? and have not they wronged you in maintaining you in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Will not the Magiſtrates ſee that they have done ſo to you in this, and become pack-horſes no longer, and executioners, who hath executed your malice upon them you do no work for, neither have hired you? and caſt them into priſon when they have ſpoken to you to repent and fear God? and ſo it's time for the Magiſtrates to do juſtice, and execute the Law upon you idle vagabonds.</p>

So if ye loſe the members, will ye take the maintenance? which of the Apoſtles did ſo? Nay, is it not the way to gain members, to deny the maintenance? Is not that the way whereby the power of God may be known that raiſeth the ſeed of God, whereby the hearts of people may be opened, and whereby the ſeed is known?

Is not God the Superiour, the ſupream? and doſt thou ſay <hi>You</hi> to God? doſt thou e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem man higher, in a place beyond God? is not this ambition and pride and preſumption and fooliſhneſſe, muſt thou not come to be judged here, and be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for your miſcariages? and <hi>Thou</hi> to a familiar, a perſon of low degree, canſt thou ſpeak more familiarly to God then to man, <hi>Thou</hi> to him, and <hi>You</hi> to man, is this righteous and ſound ſpeech that cannot be condemned? Doſt thou not in this ſhew that thou never learned the <hi>Accidence or Bible</hi> he that reſpects perſons, commits ſin; doſt thou reſpect the poor and the rich in thy words, and is by the law reproved to be a tranſgreſſor, and is out of the faith that is held without reſpect
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96882:138"/> of perſons; And as for the reſt of all thy lies and hard expreſſions in thy Book, they ſhall come upon thy ſelf, and to thee be a heavie burthen; And the day haſtens upon thee apace, to the witneſs of God in thy conſcience I ſpeak, which will let thee ſee that it had been better for thee, if thou had never opened thy mouth, then to have opened thy nakedneſs to the Nation; and this is not the way to convert ſouls, to rail; for railing never converted any, but brought them into a form out of the power, and ſo encreaſed knowledge, which was their ſorrow.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which the Apoſtles received, they received from God; ſo ye receiving it not by the ſame means, have received it from men, and not from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>The Apoſtles were eye witneſſes, and underſtood by immediate Revelation from God, inſpired with the gift of the ſpirit, more then any man could hope for ſince, and</hi> he ſaith <hi>they do not pretend any ſuch gift, nor depend upon any ſuch immediate miraculous Revelation from Heaven.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then all may ſee now in this what ye have received, that hath been from man which is not from Heaven immediate, nor the gifts of the ſpirit, nor received the Goſpel by the ſame means the Apoſtles did, who are not the eye witneſſes, as the Apoſtles were, neither have ye attained to the ſame knowledge and underſtanding as the Apoſtles did, nor received it from heaven; now let all people queſtion, whether it is the ſame Goſpel, which is not received from Heaven, nor immediately, nor by Revelation; for the Goſpel is immediate, which is the power of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. they are in the ſame power, underſtanding, knowledge, and immediate Revelation from Heaven, that the Apoſtles were in, that underſtand the Goſpel, and they that be in another, cannot underſtand that Goſpel; ſo he confeſſeth to the Nation in his anſwer to ſome Queries, and in his diſcourſe upon the holy ſpirit, that they have not the ſame knowledge, gift nor immediate Revelation as the Apoſtles had; ſo he hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf manifeſt, and the reſt of the Prieſts, that he is in the Apoſtacy, not to have the Goſpel the Apoſtles had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith page 11. <hi>An external means enables them to open the meaning of the Goſpel.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> An external opens not the eternal, this all may judge that is in the fear of God, and that is it which keepes them from being deceived, and ſeduce: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal which opens the eternal, he ſaith ſo, which is falſe; for the eternal opens the external, and the Goſpel is eternal, and that which reacheth to the ſoul which is immortal, and all they are ſeduced and ſeducers that thinks and ſaith the external muſt open the eternal.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw. Pilate</hi> was a learned man, and had Hebrew, Greek and Latine, and knew not the ſence of the Scripture, which crucified Chriſt; And the learning of God is that which knowes the Scriptures by the ſpirit that gave them forth, and not the confounded natural Languages; and the Querie to him was, whether any was to be called Maſter, his Anſwer is, <hi>Maſter is a Title of civil honour,</hi> a Phariſee, a tranſgreſſor of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. that tramples upon Chriſts command and his doctrine, and makes the doctrine of Chriſt uncivil, and this is your Lordſhip and your uſurped Authority, who
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:96882:138"/> would lord it over Gods heritage, but he is throwing you out as dung upon the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>The Phariſees paid Tythes when they neglected the Law of God.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Do not all you ſo? Is not this your condition that takes Tythes, whoſe fruits in the Nation make it manifeſt, and the Apoſtle ſaid the Prieſthood was changed that took Tythes, and the Apoſtles denyed the Phariſees that took them; but you take them by compulſion, and carry to priſon till death if you cannot get them, and in this you are worſe then the Phariſees and firſt Prieſthood that took Tythes, which denyed Chriſt was come in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>That children are of the Kingdom of God, and yet they muſt be born again before they can enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> page 17. <hi>and ſprinkling of Infants is Baptiſme.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>To give an anſwer without imagination, or conſequence, is without reaſon or Judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a reaſon and a Judgement out of imaginations and conſequences to be given, which is in truth, and out of the doubtful diſpute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prin.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>While men be upon the earth the body of ſin is not wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Contrary to the Apoſtles doctrine, who ſaith they were made free from ſin, and this is to deny the Circumciſion which puts off the body of ſin; this is to keep out of Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> in the fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>The contents of the Goſpel are things of the ſpirit of God attained by an external means, and the Apoſtles was called of God immediately, which</hi> he ſaith <hi>no man muſt hope for ſince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then you have all followed your own ſpirits and are found amongſt the number of the falſe Prophets, and them that ran and the Lord never ſpake to them; and the things of the Goſpel and of the ſpirit are not attained by an external means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>We muſt not look for an immediate extraordinary miraculous teaching from the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet he ſaith all men are taught of God; what confuſion is here? the grace of God which brings ſalvation hath appeared unto all men, and teacheth us, and this he calls an outward teaching by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Is that which brings ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation outward all in the truth may Judge this and try thy ſpirit, and the teachings of the Lord is not mediate, but extraordinary, above all yours, which are men got up ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>They ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, ſaying, know the Lord, but they ſhall all know me from the leaſt to the greateſt;</hi> and he ſaith again, <hi>the moſt knowing man hath not attained ſuch a perfection of knowledge in his gift, as not to need teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So he is one that believes not in the promiſe, they that love, are of God, and they that loveth knoweth God, and they that loveth not God, knoweth not God, here are the ſpirits of the world made manifeſt, and the ſpirit of God in his Saints, from thy confuſion; ſo them that know God are taught of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>The anointing within people, is a meaſure of ſpiritual wiſdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And yet they attain to the Goſpel by an external means, and it is onely all they that give heed to ſuch ſpirits as theſe, that go from the anointing within them, that did not take heed to the anointing, ſo going from the eternal means to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal means, and from the immediate to the mediate, with which they are now tryed which the Apoſtle ſaw come in, which hath been ſince over the world, but now made manifeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Sprinkling of Infants is Gods Ordinance.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For which they have no Scripture, but a tradition which hath been taught men for a doctrine by them who cannot ſhew where God commanded it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith pag. 31. <hi>For the ſpirit within we are not ſo blind folded to follow the dictates thereof, and we draw men from the ſpirit within; It is humane learning that diſtinguiſhes the naked Truth, whereby it is clearly ſeen,</hi> and calls them <hi>blind that ſaith otherwiſe: and cannot diſtinguiſh perſons from houſes,</hi> he confeſſeth <hi>it is contentions to go to Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here he hath given Judgement upon all the Prieſts the reſt of his fellowes, who in moſt coaſts of the Nation are troubling people for Tythes, and their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and you are blind-folded who leads people from the ſpirit within who are raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it, and hath the ſheepes cloathing in the humane learning, which is from the earth, from the ground, and that cannot diſtinguiſh the naked truth, and with that the Phariſees could not ſee Chriſt, as you be, that cannot ſee the light <hi>which hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened every man that cometh into the world,</hi> nor the Sons of God who are led by the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>The Scripture was given forth in the Hebrew, Greek, and Latine which we truely ſay is the Original, and to attain ſpiritual wiſdom by depending upon miraculous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations from heaven, is attempting the good Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And here he is contrary to the Apoſtle, what he had received from the Lord he declared, and <hi>David</hi> waited upon the Lord, and all the Prophets of God for Counſel and teaching and Revelation, and this he calls a Temptation, which no one knowes the Son but by Revelation, nor the Father, nor the Scripture, not a Hebrew, nor a Greek, nor a Latiniſt, but they that think to find it out by natural Languages, are in the temptation from the Spirit of God which reveals the deep things of God, which to all you inwardly raveners, is miraculous; and as for the reſt of thy confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and lies, it is not worth the mentioning, but ſhall cover thy ſelf, thy Judgement, the witneſs ſhall anſwer and manifeſt thy cloathing.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Contrary to the Apoſtles Doctrine, who ſaid, they were of his fleſh and of his bone; and Chriſt in you, and he would walk in them: And <hi>he that hath not the ſpirit of Chriſt is none of his,</hi> and they are of his fleſh and of his bone, and <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>It is a Devilliſh doctine not to forſake quaking and trembling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So in this thou mayeſt ſay, it is Devilliſh doctrine to ſay, ſalvation muſt be wrought out by trembling and quaking; ſo thou ſheweſt thou never knew ſalvation; for before men have ſalvation wrought out, they muſt know trembling and quaking; and ſo thou haſt ſhut thy ſelfe out from <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> condition, and ſuch as the Lord regards and trembles at his word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prin.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Fleſh and bone cannot be a meaſure in one, and a meaſure in another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>we are of his fleſh and of his bone.</hi> Here thou art contrary to the Apoſtle, and that was more then one that had the fleſh of Chriſt and his bone, and his ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Pr. He cries, <hi>Oh Luciferian pride to ſave ſouls!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What good doth all your preaching do? Here thou ſpoileſt all the reſt of the Prieſts, and ſhews thy ſelfe to be contrary to the Apoſtles, who watched for the ſoul, and ſaved ſouls, that turned people from a multitude of ſins.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>God the Father never took upon him humane nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Contrary to the Scripture, who ſaith, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelfe,</hi> and art ignorant of the great myſtery, God manifeſt in the fleſh, and his name is called the everlaſting Father. As for the word <hi>Humane,</hi> which is from the ground, it comes from thy own knowledge which is earthly; and Chriſt took upon him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> according to the fleſh, and this is Scripture-Language.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith; <hi>The holy Ghoſt is a perſon, and that there was a Trinity of three perſons before Christ was born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou knoweſt not him that is in the Father, and the Father in him, glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Father before the world began: And the Scriptures doth not tell people of a Trinity nor three perſons; but the Common-prayer-Maſſe-book ſpeaks of three perſons brought in by thy father the Pope, and the Father, Son, and holy Spirit was always one.</p>
               <p>Pr. He compares <hi>immediate revelation from heaven</hi> like unto the <hi>falſe Prophets dreams.</hi> And again he ſaith, <hi>the Scriptures is the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here he fights with the reſt of his fellows, who ſaith, Scriptures ſignifies writings, and writings are not God; but the Scriptures of truth are Gods words, which Chriſt, the Word, fulfils: They are not the word of God which thou haſt blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96882:140"/> affirmed, but Chriſt is the word of God; and they be out of the feare of God and the ſpirit, and knows not the Son nor the Father that denies Revelations, but are among the falſe Prophets and falſe Dreamers.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>The Scriptures are the Word, except you dare to deny Chriſt is God.</hi> And he brings a Scripture, <hi>Let the word of God dwell in you richly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So he makes the Scripture Chriſt, and God, and he doth not ſay, <hi>let Chriſt dwell in you,</hi> but means the Scripture and God dwels in you: And the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Let Chriſt dwell in your hearts by faith,</hi> and God will dwell in you; but thou ſaith, Chriſt doth not dwell in them perſonally. Doth not Chriſt dwell in his Saints, as he is in the perſon of the Father, the ſubſtance? and are not they of his fleſh, and of his bone?</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>They that hear the Word of God do not hear the Son, the holy Scriptures are the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now all people, where ever did you read of a mediate word of God? Doth not the word of God endure for ever, and is it mediate? And that he calls God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, and never heard his voyce, nor his Sons, and denies immediate teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and he that knows the ſpirit that gave forth Scriptures, hears the Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>God limits the ſupream holy one by the inſpired writings of the Apoſtles; and that is his third diſpenſation of his minde to men:</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>they are taught by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Scriptures, which is mediate; not by Letter, which is litterally, the Letters or Letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Inſpired Scriptures, and yet mediate, the teſtimony of Jeſus is the ſpirit of prophecy; and the Spirit inſpires, which the Letter doth not; and Gods teaching is by his ſpirit, and the holy one is not limited by the words of the Apoſtles who fulfils them, and many words the Apoſtles ſpoke which he did not write.</p>
               <p>Pr. And he calls <hi>the Devill the tutor, to ſay, not made Miniſter of the Letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So we ſpeak the Apoſtles words, and he makes the Devill the Apoſtles tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who ſaid, <hi>the letter killeth, but the ſpirit gives life,</hi> who was not a Miniſter of the Letter, but of the ſpirit, ſaid, and ſayes this, that makes the Devill the Apoſtles tutor, which is a lye, and his own; and the Devill is the Tutor of the Miniſters of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not of the Spirit; who can run into it, who is out of the truth.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſpeaks <hi>of a morall Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Which he hath no Scripture for, the Scripture ſpeaks no ſuch thing, but dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens counſell by his words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>The Scripture contains the mediate inſpired teachings, written word of God, that was and is God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Which the Scriptures ſay, the heaven of heavens cannot contain him; and God and Chriſt was before any written words was; and the mediate teaching of the whole Scripture-letter he ſpeaks of, which he calls God and Chriſt; and all the mediate teaching is carnall, and the Scriptures doth not continue the immediate teachings of Gods inſpiration, but teſtifies of thoſe things.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>The written word is the ſword of the ſpirit.</hi> And he makes another rule, <hi>beſides the Scripture's, falſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Which we ſay is the ſpirit that gave them forth, whereby peace is known upon the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God; And the Phariſees had the Scriptures, but had not the ſword of the ſpirit, the Scriptures teſtifies of the ſword of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>It is a lye to ſay the Saints ſhall judge the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So he would make Chriſt and the Apoſtles lyars, and would take the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Son, and make Chriſt at a diſtance from the Saints, ſo he is ignorant of the Saints and Chriſt both, and knows not the time of the Saints judging when the Lord is come; but ſtands in the counſels of his own heart, and in the hidden things of darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>No Saint can be a judge of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Contrary to <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Do ye not know the Saints ſhall
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96882:141"/> judge the world?</hi> And they abide not in the truth that affirms it as thou ſaith; ſo haſt ſhewed thy ignorance, and one of them that is judged by the Saints.</p>
               <p>Pr. He denies <hi>the Son of God to be revealed in man onely by adoption,</hi> and cries againſt <hi>equality with the Father.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And that is contrary to the Apoſtle, who had the Son of God revealed in him. And the Aſſembly of Divines gave forth a Catechiſme, which children, old and young was to learn, and ſaid, <hi>the holy Ghoſt and Son was equall in ſubſtance, and power, and glory with the Father;</hi> What, then all that have the Son and the holy Ghoſt, hath that which is equall in power and glory with the Father. In this thou haſt not onely judged thy ſelfe, but all the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> 1649.</p>

How can you for ſhame ſay you leave your wordly intereſt, when you are but running into them when you come to be Prieſts and miniſters? who are the proudeſt people in the pariſh in the glories and vanities of the world and honor of it but the prieſt, and his wife, and his children? Are not you worſe then Lawyers and Phiſitians, taking the peoples money, &amp; yet cannot make them perfect men, but ſay they muſt not be perfect. The Phiſitian is to make one perfect, doe they take money of people they do naught for? are they not aſhamed to doe ſo? but you take money of them you doe no worke for, are you not worſe then the Lawyers who are bad? doe you not take money of ſuch people you do not worke for, and ſue them and caſt them into priſon? Are you not the unreaſonableſt men upon the earth? and this is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils game you are playing; and doe you not live in more honour in the world, greater gain, and no worke done for it, then any people in the Nation againe, as the Goals in the Nation may witneſſe your fruits.</p>

This ſhews that you are not able to ſtop their mouths, nor reſiſt the ſpirits of them whom you ſay, it will be no more perſecution for the Magiſtrate to ſtop their mouths, then to hang a thief. And thus to all Magiſtrates that feare God you appear with ſhame; and all may ſee what you crouch for under the mountains, for blood, <hi>Jezebe</hi> like, and makes the Magiſtrates your pack-horſes and executioners of your malice; but the Lord God of heaven and earth in his wiſdome is opening the eyes of many; that moderation appeares in ſuch in whoſe hearts the feare of the Lord is placed, that tries many of you, and turns many of you to your own weapons, to ſee what weapons you have, and they finde you but wreſtlers againſt fleſh and blood, ſtriking at the creatures, not at the power which captivates them, to bring them out of it into the liberty of the ſons of God. The true Miniſters work was to beat down blaſphemers errours, falſe Prophets, and ſtop the mouths of gain-ſayers: Rebuke, exhort, teach, inſtruct with all authority, cut off occaſions with ſpirituall weapons: And this power had they in the Church, and cryed not to the Magiſtrate, take them away, they diſturb me! Oh ſhameleſs! ſhame thy ſelfe before all the people in the Congregation! This was not the work of the Miniſters of Chriſt to do ſo; And this authority in the Church before mentioned, had the Miniſters of Chriſt to ſtop the mouths of Gain-ſayers, ſilence falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and blaſphemers. This power and authority they had from God, and looked not at men to help them; but they which apoſtatized from the Apoſtles, the Beaſt, the falſe Prophet, the mother of Harlots that deceived the Nations, that be out of the power of the Apoſtles and Chriſt, &amp; have their power from men, all the falſe Miniſters upon earth are ſeeking to them to ſtop blaſphemers as they imagine, being but contrary to their mindes, while they themſelves are the

                  <hi>Pr. Richard Mayo ſaith, That it is not unlawfull to ſay</hi> You <hi>to a ſingle perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:96882:156"/>
               <p>Anſ In this thou ſheweſt thou never readſt the <hi>Accidence</hi> or <hi>Bible,</hi> and it is unlawfull to ſpeak unrightouſly, and to ſay there is many when there is but one to call one many (you one.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. That Ministers may exhort men to walke by the light of Reaſon, as well as the light of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. No man walks by the light of reaſon, but who be in the faith, are in the light of the Goſpell, and all other reaſon is as the beaſts of the field, that which makes men reaſonable is faith, and all that be in the faith are in the light of the Goſpell, and this is one, which all unreaſonableneſſe is out of it, in the tranſgreſſion, for none are in the reaſonableneſſe, but ſuch as comes out of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and ſuch as be reaſonable walkes by the light of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. That the Goſpel it ſelfe is but a dead letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. The Goſpel it ſelfe is the power of God, that which the letter ſpeaks of, which many may have the letter, the form, and deny the power of God, and ſo have not the Goſpell,</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That the Goſpel is no more the power of God then the roſe cake that lay in his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. The Goſpell is the power of God preached in every creature, more then a roſe cake; that gives every creature its living and being? for it relieves the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, turnes againſt the oppreſſor; ſo is called glad tidings, for the Goſpell is preached unto every creature in heaven, which is the power of God, which turnes againſt that which bondageth, to wit, the corruptions, and ſo gives liberty and freedom to the captives, and this is glad tidings which is the power of God, and is more then any Creature, and all the creatures, that which gives liberty and freedom to all, is glad tidings.</p>
               <p>Richard Mayo further ſaith, <hi>It was no matter to him if the devill was the originall of Tithes, if the Law of the Land would give it him, he would have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We doe believe thee, his ſervant thou art, thy ſeared conſcience and hardneſſe of heart diſcovers it, but the miniſters of Chriſt and the Goſpell never preached nor held forth ſuch doctrine, nor would never act any thing from that which the Devil was the originall of, which thou doſt ſay thou would take tythes though he was the originall of them, if the Law of the Land would give it thee; he hath been the originall of them, and the Popes Lawes firſt ſet them up, whereby the Saints goods are ſtrained and ſpoiled and made havock of, and art not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſpoyling of their goods, but you bring their bodies into your prieſts den; and thus you eate up people, and ſwallow up the needy for a thing of nought, as they did of old, your as fore-fathers did tranſgreſſe for a paire of ſhoos.</p>
               <p>Pr. He ſaith, <hi>Cain was no vagabond after he had built a City,</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>there was no ſcripture as that the Apoſtles had no certaine dwelling place; and that the ſteeple-houſe was the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. This is contrary to ſcripture; for <hi>Cain</hi> was a vagabond, though he builded a City, and diſobeyed the command of God, and loſt his habitation in God, ſo all great men upon the earth, though they build a City, and are Lords, and Earls, and Dukes, and Princes, and Kings, if they doe diſobey the command of God, and doe not dwell in him, they have no habitation, but are all vagabonds; and <hi>Paul</hi> had no certain dwelling place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 11. and yet he had a habitation in God, and was no vagabond, and the ſteeple-houſe is no Church, but the old Maſſe-houſe ſet up ſince the daies of the Apoſtles, ſince they loſt the true Church, <hi>Theſs.</hi> the 1.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. WE diſtinguiſh between the Eſſential word, and the declarative word, we own Chriſt to be the Eſſential, and the Scripture to be the Letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scripture tells us that Chriſt is the word; the Scriptures of truth that was given forth from the ſpirit of truth, were the words of God, in whom they end in Chriſt the word; and you talk of a declarative word, and the Scripture you call a Hiſtory; and you call it a Creed, and you call it a Catologue; and theſe Titles and names you have given to the Scripture of truth, the words of God, which as I ſaid before was the Scripture of truth the words of God given forth from the ſpirit of God which ends in Chriſt, and doth not ſpeak of a declarative word, but you in your nicity.</p>
               <p>Prin. <hi>There is a two-fold comming of the Goſpel, the one in word, the other in power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The blind people here thou wouldſt make believe that the word was not the power, which the word and the power is one, for Chriſt the word, and Chriſt the power of God, his name is called the power of God, and he that Miniſters the word, Miniſters the power of God and the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>The Saints that ſtood upon mount Sion that followed the Lamb; thoſe Saints that was without guil before the throne of God, is to be underſtood in the juſtification and not in ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that is ſpoken of in the Revelations</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here thou haſt manifeſted thy ſelf to be an accuſer of the Brethren who are juſtified, and ſaid to be without fault; now who are juſtified, are ſanctified, and are juſtified; it was ſaid, in their mouths was no guile; they were not defiled; and now theſe that have no guile, and are juſtified, and were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with women, ſuch are ſanctified; ſo that thou Judgeſt of things that are too mighty for thee; and medles with things that are two weighty, and brings Judgement upon thy own head; whoſe meaſure is meaſured and weights are tryed; and thou art of them that art found too light.</p>
               <p>Prin. <hi>He that is born of God ſins not, after the ſame ſort as them that are of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He that commits ſin is the ſervant of ſin, and he that commits ſin is of the Devil; and he that is born of God doth not commit ſin, for he cannot, becauſe he is born of God; born of that nature which cannot ſin; and thoſe who doth ſin is of the Devil, is of the ſame nature of their father; but he that is born of God doth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Pr. <hi>As</hi> John <hi>ſaith; as he is, ſo are we in this preſent world, that Scripture,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo in the latitude of it.</hi>

               <p>Pr. <hi>Christ was holy from his conception, ſo are not we,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>but we are ſanctified; in time, Christ was holy, and ſo are not we, for there still remains the in dwelling of ſin in us.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. That the Saints are compleat in point of juſtification, and not in ſanctification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> They that are not compleat in ſanctification, they are not compleat in juſtification, for they are one; they that are compleat in the one, are compleat in the other; and ſo farre as a man is ſanctified, ſo far is he juſtified, and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for the ſame that ſanctifies a man, juſtifies him; for the ſame that is his ſanctification, is his juſtification, and his wiſdome, is his redemption; he that knows one of them, knows all; he that doth not feel one of them, feels none of them at all, for they are all one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. Faith juſtifies onely inſtrumentally; neither doth it justifie instrumentally as a worke wrought in us by the ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The man is blinde, he is angry there, and fretting himſelf about things that are too weighty for him, about things that he knows not; For faith is the gift of God which purifies the heart, which brings people to have acceſſe to God; In that, and by that which purifies men, men are juſtified, and in that's vertue, by the hearing of that, men receive the ſpirit; ſo that this is confuſion, and contrary to the Scripture, and confuted by it; for ye are juſtified through faith, and by the ſpirit, and that inſtrumentally from God, in which men pleaſe him, and without which they cannot; therefore that is inſtrumentall, and in that they have victory, and in that they have unity one with another, and in it have acceſſe to God: But ſaith he, <hi>faith doth not juſtifie inſtrumentally by any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that is in it any more then is in love.</hi> Love and faith is one, without faith there is not love: Love is the fruit of faith, flows from it, without it there is not unity, and without faith there is no victory, and without victory there's no love, and it juſtifies and is wrought by the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. A perfect conformity to the Law of God wrote in the ſtrength and power of grace, the ſpirit working all in us and for us, and all this is no more then the righteouſneſſe of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That's the end of the Law that brings to the righteouſneſſe of the Law, and to a perfect conformity to it, and fulfills it; that's the ſeed Chriſt in the male, and in the female, by whom grace comes by Jeſus Chriſt, which brings to live in the righteouſneſſe of it, which is the righteouſneſſe of faith, by which the ſpirit is received, which works all in people, and for them, who ends the Law.</p>

               <p>Pr. <hi>That they are brought to the Church that is in God, the pillar and ground of truth, where there's neither ſpot nor wrinkle, nor any ſuch thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And yet you never heard the voyce of God; and how can you be brought to the Church that is in God, and never heard the voyce of God? for none comes to the Son, but through the drawings of the Father; and none knows the drawings of the Father, but they heard his voyce. The <hi>Jewes</hi> that came not to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:96882:159"/> the Son, Chriſt told them, they had not known the voyce of God; and none come to him, but whom the Father draweth.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>We do not look for any ſuch thing as revelation from heaven, or ſpeaking as they are moved, or waiting for the power as the Apoſtles did, we ſay we do not looke for any ſuch thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This ſhews that you have not received the grace; for the grace comes by revelation, and you have not received the Son; for the Son comes by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; Nor you have not known the Father whom the Son reveales; You are not come to the holy Ghoſt whom the Saints witneſſed, that led them to ſpeak forth Scriptures, which no propheſie of the Scriptures came by the will of man; ſo you are among thoſe men that have the Scriptures in their wills, and wants the thing that the Scriptures were given forth by, that is the holy Ghoſt, for holy men of God were moved to ſpeak them forth, who learned them of God, and ſpoke them forth as the ſpirit gave them utterance; Therefore how can ye ſay, that you are come to the Church in God, and waits neither for the power nor revelation as the Saints did, and were in; for if you have all the Scriptures, and have not that, you have not revelation, and have not the holy Ghoſt; for the Scriptures are not known but by revelation, and they are revealed by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that gave them forth: And though men have all the Scriptures, yet the Son is not known but by revelation of the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. The Scripture is the Goſpell, the Scripture is the Light, the Scripture is the Word.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Scriptures are the words of God given forth from the ſpirit of God, learned from him: The Goſpel is the power of God, the Scripture declares it. A man may have the forme, and deny the power, and ſo deny the Goſpel; Chriſt is the light of the world, the life and the light of men by whom the world was made; and many have the Scriptures, but denies the light, the life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it, Chriſt Jeſus, who is the life, and power, and the authority of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. That they knew no law of God againſt praying and preaching by an hour-glaſſe; and that the Apoſtles did performe the Ordinances of God at ſet times; and</hi> Daniel <hi>and</hi> David <hi>prayed cuſtomarily, and how this can be ſaid to be will worſhip, and to be ſeen of men, we ſhall leave it to the Lord.</hi>

And as for your creed, that you have learned of your Father the Pope, the ſcriptures tells you not that, nor doth not teach you the word humane, neither, ſo you and the Papiſts hath creeped into the Apoſtles words, but be out of the life, who are proud and covetouſs</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. We deny not to teach people, young miniſters to stop the mouthes of ſlandrous adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; to cure jealouſies of diſtempred minds, we all are ready in every Proteſtant Church, to give men a full account of our faith, in plaine confeſſion: but with this proteſtation, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the holy ſcriptures is the rule of faith: if any thing in our confeſſion, be found diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that rule, we are ready when we underſtand ſo much, to diſowne it, and to Correct it.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> How do you ſtop their mouthes in haling them before Magiſtrates, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in priſons, is this your ſtopping? is not this your worke? let the Goales witneſſe, the houſes of correction witneſſe how you have ſtopped their mouths, and convinced gain-ſayers, now that which is truth and ſpeakes plainly to you, ye call that
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:96882:168"/> adverſaries or ſlanderers. Now it is not a ſlander to call a Lamb, a Lamb, a Dog, a Dog, or Swine, Swine; But to ſay a Lamb is a Swine, a Dog is a Sheep, that is a lye; or a Wolfe is a Sheep, though he hath got on a ſheeps cloathing on him, and is covered with them, and therefore would be called a ſheep that he may deceive; and would not be called a Wolfe, though his fruits declare it. His reviling, devouring, having ſheeps cloathing, caſting into Priſon, and yet is offended if ye call him not a ſheep, or a Miniſter of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Nay the truth, the Lambs, the Sheep cannot do ſo, but they muſt ſpeak the truth to you; and though you do devour them, and tear them, they will not tear you again: And though you Wolves have on the ſheeps cloathing, which caſt into priſon becauſe they will not feed you. Did ever the Lambs do ſo, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt? Were not they fed in his paſture? followed him, and knew his voyce, and did not want? But how have you cured the jealouſies and diſeaſed mindes all this while? Yee have wounded them, made them ſick, and filled them full of jealouſies; therefore are the people broken into heaps and ſects, that's the fruit of jealouſies one of another. And how have you been ready, you called Teachers, apoſtatized from the Apoſtles, to render to every Proteſtant Church a full account of your faith in plain confeſſion, when many hundreds have been moved of the Lord God to come in thoſe places called Churches, and asked you a queſtion, cry take him away Mngiſtrate, to priſon with him, he hath broken the Law, neighbours? and this hath ſhewed your faithleſneſſe: And many have been moved to come to the Steeple-houſe, and look the Prieſt in the face, and he hath cryed take him away, I cannot go forward, I cannot ſpeak as long as he ſtands there; and here you have ſhewed your faithleſneſs again, wanting the weapons, the ſhield of faith.</p>
               <p>But you ſay again, they muſt own the holy Scriptures to be the rule of faith: So then not Chriſt, not God the Author. What rule might <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> own, was not God the author of their faith? And is he not the ſame now? Had not the Phariſees the Scriptures? had not they the rule that ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt the Faiths Author, and the rule which the Saints looked at? Are not they that are of faith, of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was before Scripture was written? Is the Scripture the ground of theſe? Nay, the ground of this is that which was before Scripture was written, and they were in the faith that ſtood in God that gave it forth, and the Scriptures; and ſo here you be correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Scriptures, and your Churches both. For all may ſpeak one by one in the true Church; but this authority you have thrown down, who are ſuch as preach for the fleece, and the filthy lucre, and gain from their Quarters, called of men Maſters, ſuing for Tythes, going to Law about earthly things, which did not the Apoſtles, but rebuked ſuch: And ſo you are corrected by the Scriptures, and you are judged with the life of the Prophets, Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, and both Church and Miniſters are departed from it.</p>

Nay, they put them to death that were in the ſpirit, they did, that had the ſheeps cloathing; and the ſpirit of Chriſt, who hath it, can tell who wrongs Chriſts words: And why did not the Miniſters of <hi>Ireland</hi> which had Chriſts words, Prophets &amp; Apoſtles, ſtop the mouth of <hi>Edward Burrough,</hi> and <hi>Francis Howgill,</hi> but ſuffered them to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of the Nation, or cauſed them: You looked upon them to be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, which be the ſervants ot the Lord; and yet you were not able to ſtop their mouths, though you had all the ſheeps cloathing, neither were able to reſiſt their ſpirit which ſhews your ſpirit; And that you are not fit to ſend forth Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, nor make Miniſters, nor try Miniſters; and the Apoſtle doth not ſay, that the Letter is the onely rule or tryall; but if people have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, they are none of his, and have not Chriſt in them, they are reprobates.

And the ſoule, you that are called Miniſters ſaith it is <hi>humane; yea, the ſoule of Chriſt, the ſoule of man is appetite, and luſt, and pleaſure, and humane,</hi> from the earth, from the ground; Is Chriſts ſoule from the ground? and appetite, luſt, and pleaſure wars againſt the ſoul, in them that be in the unreaſonableneſſe. You that have the light to ſeek, truth to ſeek, and way to ſeek, are in the earth, and ſo gives the ſoule the name of that which comes from the ground. Now the ſoule is immortall; God breathed into man the breath of life, and he became a living ſoule. It is that which came out from God, who hath all ſouls in his hand, that's his power; which hand goes againſt him that doth evill. And Chriſt the power of God which is immortall, is the ſouls Biſhop, which is immortall, from whence it hath its nouriſhment, and the immortall, which is able to ſave the immortal ſoul.</p>

               <p>Pr. <hi>The Light which is in every man is but darkneſs, being compared with a Revelation of Chriſt in the Saints, our Juſtification hath its riſe from what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for us, not from what he hath done in us, Juſtification and Sanctification are ever diſtinct in their nature, diſtinct one from the other, Juſtification is not Sanctification, nor Sanctification Juſtification, but two things real diſtinct in their nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The light which every man that cometh into the world is lightned withall, is Chriſt, and this light reveals Chriſt, and the Saints light, and this light is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to the world which hates it. And no man knoweth juſtification, but as he knoweth it wrought within, from Chriſt, and no man knowes the ſeed that was offered, the ſacrifice of the whole world, but as he knowes it within, through the faith, and who are of the faith they are of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they are of the fleſh of Chriſt, the fleſh of him that ſuffered, and if men have not Chriſt within them, they have not juſtification, and though they may talk of him without, and have him not within, ſuch are reprobates, that hath not Chriſt within them, reprobate from Chriſt, from juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſanctification both, but are of the generation that cauſed him to ſuffer, and juſtification and ſanctification are one, not diſtinguiſhed the one from the other in their natures, but are one in nature, not two things really diſtinct in their nature, but really one, for Chriſt our ſanctification, and juſtification, he that ſanctifies and juſtifies, they are one in nature, which is Chriſt, which is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and juſtification both, and thou art rebuked which makes two of them, and diſtinct, when its but one thing, the ſame that juſtifies, ſanctifies.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>If the fulfilling of the righteous Law in us be Juſtification, then Chriſt died in vain, Juſtification is the direct oppoſite to condemnation, that which makes a change in the heart of the creature, is ſanctification and juſtification, faith doth not ſave nor juſtifie by vertue of any worth or excellencie found in it, nor merely becauſe Chriſt is the object of it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He that fulfills the righteouſneſs of the Law in us, is Chriſt the juſtification hereby men come to know him, that he redeems them from under the Law, and they are led by the ſpirit; And they know he is their interceſſion, and died not in vain: and he ends the Law, who fulfills it. And he is the juſtification to every one that believes. And this is known in us, that do believe to the juſtification of it, whereby a tittle of it is ſeen not to be broken, whereby the body of Chriſt is ſeen, which makes free from the Law, and Chriſt is the light that condemns him that hates it, that will not come to it becauſe his deeds are evil, nor believe in it, and that is the condemnation of the world, that light is come into it, and men love darkneſs rather then light, becauſe their deeds are evil. And he that believes in the light is juſtified from all things that the law could not juſtifie him, and comes not into condemnation, but lives in that which doth condemn; ſo theſe are one, and not directly oppoſite, that doth condemn the unbeliever, and juſtifie the believer. And people are ſaved through faith, and juſtified; and faith is the gift of God, and there is an excellency in it, and a worth, becauſe it comes from Chriſt, and God who is the Author of it, in which faith men pleaſe God, and are juſtified and are ſaved through faith, and by faith, as the Scripture witneſſeth.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>Faith doth not ſave nor juſtifie by its vertue, but of the gracious good pleaſure of God which hath appointed faith.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which God hath given to men which is his gift, in that faith there is vertue, and the grace is known with which men are juſtified and ſaved, and there is vertue in the gift of God, and ſo through this faith he knowes the purpoſe of the Lord, and his counſel, and Chriſt is the Author of this faith, and no man is juſtified but through faith that is received, nor wiſe unto ſalvation, but through faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

               <p>Anſ. The Grace of God hath appeared to all men, which teacheth the ſaints, and the grace is brought by the revelation of Jeſus, as ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> by revelation, and the grace is the gift of God, and not attained by an outward meanes, by mans will, and they that turne it into laſciviouſneſſe, the grace of God that hath appeared, are them that deny the Lord that bought them, which goes from the grace, which is the ſaints tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, which brings ſalvation.</p>

Before the ſcripture was written or given forth, <hi>Abraham, Enoch</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> had that to inform their minds, and let them ſee Chriſt and the Jews had ſcripture, and knew not Chriſt, they had the teſtification, and did not come to him they teſtified of, and ſo had not life, ſo that which is to inform the minds of all people is the ſpirit and the light which Chriſt hath enlightned them withall, and ſuch their eares and eyes muſt be open to that the ſpirit of God in themſelves, before they hear his voice, which ſpirit informes their mindes to God, and then they ſhall come to know the operation of the ſpirit, which many may have the ſcriptures, and not know that, and that which is to teach people is the grace Chriſt, and God, and the light and life, and that it is which informes the mind to know ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>Prieſt</hi> Dorker ſaid, <hi>That the word of God was the ordinary outward meanes, and that the ſcripture is the word,</hi> they all affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The word of God is not outward nor ordinary, but extraordinary, it is that which lives, abides &amp; endures for ever, and the ſcriptures are to be fulfilled &amp; that which doth fulfill them is the word, and the ſcriptures of truth learned of God the Father of truth, are the words of God, not a word <hi>God ſpake all theſe words, and ſaid, in Exodus,</hi> and my words, ſaith Chriſt; and whoſoever ſhall add to theſe words, ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Revelations:</hi> and ſo the words are the ſcriptures of truth, that cannot be broken, Chriſt the word ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files them, who was in the beginning, before the words was ſpoken forth, who is and remaines to the words end, who fulfills them in whom they end.</p>

Here all may ſee, The <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and their Church, and their Perſecution, againſt the Saints, and Lambs, Servants, and Children of God, which the Lord moved to go among them, to viſit the Seed of God, in that dark wilderneſs-Country, who has been as Sheep among Wolves. Alſo, How pure Religion is turned upſide down, and vain Religion got in its place. And the pure Doctrine of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, which ſaith, Entertain Strangers, Love Enemies is loſt among you; In ſtead of entertaining ſtrangers, and loving enemies, they Impriſon and Perſecute, and have made their Church unſavoury: And the Teachers fruits declares to be falſe, who are wreſtlers againſt fleſh and blood, and ſtrikers at creatures which Chriſt and the Apoſtles did not.

               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. THat Christ hath not enlightned every one that comes into the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Which is contrary to <hi>Johns</hi> doctrine <hi>John</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. That Christ doth enlighten none but thoſe that do receive him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Contrary to <hi>John</hi> 3. ſpeaking of them which hate the light, and are enlightned and will not come to it, becauſe the light will reprove them; ſo he that hates the light is enlightned, and will not receive Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. That it is blaſphemy to ſay, that the true light doth enlighten and condemn the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Contrary to <hi>John</hi> 1.9. &amp; 3.19. <hi>that ſaith,</hi> This is the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world. And this is the condemnation of the world, that light is come into the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. To ſay, that which reproves for ſin is from Heaven, is blaſphemy.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Contrary to <hi>John</hi> 16.8. which ſaith it is the ſpirit that reproves, which comes from the Father, and the Son, which is from Heaven.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>He cryeth up a natural light, as Sun, Moon and Stars, and the light of Chriſt was before theſe was made,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>it is blaſphemy to ſay, they that did the things contained in the Law was bleſſed in the deed, and the Apoſtle ſaid the doers of the Law was juſtified;</hi> and ſaid <hi>he would leave the Friends that ſpake to him, to the mercy of the people.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Contrary to the Apoſtles doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. For whatſoever may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for the inviſible things of him from the Creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:96882:181"/> made, even his eternal power and God-head, ſo that they are without excuſe. So with that of God in them they know the inviſible things from the foundation of the world, and with that they ſee the God-head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. That God was to be known by the things that were made, as the Sun, Moon, and Stars.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11 27. No man knowes the Father but the Son, and he to whomſoever the Sun will reveal him, and the heathens know not God, nor the <hi>Jewes</hi> had not ſeen his ſhape. And his ſervants and workmen did throw water, ſtones and lime, and perſecuted, and dirtted, and abuſed the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and threw a pan full of water in a Souldiers neck, and he the ſaid Prieſt never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them; and theſe be the fruits of him, and his own Family, in ſtead of gravity: well may the whole Pariſh be out of order, when his own Family is thus. So he is one that is reproved by the Apoſtles doctrine. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. which ſaith, If you cannot rule your own Family, how can you take care for the Church of God?</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the blinde zeal that ſtones, not the Chriſtian zeal, that have the life of Chriſt; for the Chriſtian zeal is to pray for them that perſecute, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. and not to ſtone them, &amp; to love enemies: it was the <hi>Jews</hi> zeal that took up ſtones to ſtone Chriſt <hi>John</hi> 8.59. they ſtoned <hi>Steven. Acts</hi> 7.5.8. and ſtoned the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.19. In this the <hi>Presbytrians</hi> have proved their Chriſtianity to be out of Chriſt and the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Prin. <hi>If Paul and the reſt of the Apoſtles had been alive, they would have ſtoned the</hi> Quakers.</p>

Now ſee whoſe Miniſter this man is, that cannot bear, but would have them ſtoned, and would have the Apoſtle as bad as himſelf, which Apoſtle ſaid, Chriſt was his example, who laid down his life for his enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. who ſuffered the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of ſinners, we will render evil to no man, but ſay the contrary, the Lord Jeſus forgive them, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. and the Apoſtle ſaid, they wreſtled not againſt fleſh and blood, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. but them and you that ſtone, do ye not wreſtle againſt fleſh and blood? But if the Apoſtles would have ſtoned, would they not have wreſtled againſt fleſh and blood? And if the Apoſtles ſhould have ſtoned all that were contrary to their minds, &amp; bidden the people ſtone them, &amp; told them it was Chriſtian zeal, what work would they have made? as the ſaid <hi>Henry Foreſide,</hi> called Miniſter, doth, where would have been long ſuffering? <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. and loving enemies? <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. and where would he have had any to have converted? and who would have been perſecutors? and who would have prayed for perſecutors? ye may ſee what a pit ye are fallen into, and how ſhould they have convinced gain-ſayers, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.9. and loved them when they had ſtoned them. And this is the Presbyterians zeal of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and not Chriſtan zeal, who would ſtone, and ſtir up his Congregation to do ſo; for Chriſt, who is cloathed with zeal, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59 17. ſaid, <hi>Love your Enemies,</hi> but ye are cloathed with madneſs and folly: And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle that was in his zeal according to knowledge ſaid, Overcome evil with good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.21. and vengeance is the Lords, and he will repay it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. and love bears all things; but his blind zeal cannot bear any thing, but cryes ſtone them out of the way, and ſo wickedly and deviliſhly calls it Chriſtian zeal, which is falſe, that is, the Devils zeal. Now the Apoſtles wreſtled not againſt fleſh and blood,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:96882:182"/> but againſt the powers of darkneſſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. but the Presbyterians called miniſters are ſtriking againſt fleſh and blood, whilſt ye would ſtone them, whilſt that time ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall wickedneſſe lies within you.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here is one that is charging the elect, and laying ſin to the elect that God juſtifies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. that in the godly there ſhould he ſin. Sin is out of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the ungodly, which turne the grace of God into wantonneſſe; and what good doth his preaching doe them, if they muſt never be without ſin whilſt they are upon earth, they can be but in their ſin if they never preach to them: But the ſcripture ſaith, <hi>He that believes is borne of God, and he that is borne of God cannot ſin, becauſe his ſeed remaines in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.9. But this is of another world to him, who is called <hi>James Dorram</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> Miniſter of darkneſſe, who puts no difference between the children of God and the children of the devill, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.10. They would have ſin whilſt they are upon the earth, and it is darkneſſe, but the Apoſtles ſaid they were made free from ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. whilſt they were upon the earth.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt being ſeperated from ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. who are in Chriſt are ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from ſinners and ſin both, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 17. But this <hi>James Dorram</hi> hath made the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of none effect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. which hath perfected for ever them that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; And hath made the blood of Jeſus of none effect, which cleanſeth from all ſin 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. And he hath made the everlaſting Covenant of none effect which blots out all ſins &amp; treſpaſſes? And he hath made the faith of the Son of God of none effect, which purifies the heart, and gives victory over the world, <hi>Acts.</hi> 15.9. 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.5. Thou doſt herein preach and hold up ſin, and doth not preach it down; and yet thou ſaiſt thou preacheſt not to hold it up, and yet thou preacheſt they muſt have it whilſt they are upon the earth; here is confuſion in thy tongue, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.20. Thou ſhouldſt have preached it down, and have brought them to a Church where there is neither ſpot nor wrinkle, nor blemiſh nor any ſuch thing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.27. if thou wert a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, but your Church is full of ſpots, and blemiſhes, and wrinkles, whilſt ye are preaching up zeale to ſtone people, and ſin while they live, as <hi>Henry Foreſide and Iames Dorram</hi> doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr. God be thanked the ſcripture ſpeakes nothing for freedome from ſin and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. Thou thankeſt God that thou maiſt live in thy ſin and imperfection, and art glad of this thy falſe hope, but thou art a lyar, thou art out of the truth in this, for the ſcripture ſaith they were made free from ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.26. and they preached wiſdome among them that were perfect, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. and he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Contrary to ſcripture, contrary to Chriſts words, and contrary to the Apoſtles words is thy doctrine and Principles, for every gift of God is perfect, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. For Chriſt is the gift of God, and he will give him for a Covenant of light to the Jewes, and Gentiles, which doth enlighten every man that commeth into the world, which every one that doth truth comes to it, which every one that doth evill hates the light, and will not come to the light becauſe the light will reprove him; and ſo, This is the condemnation of the world, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſſe rather then light, becauſe their deeds be evill. So this light is perfect, which doth reprove every man of ſin, and is from above, and it is the gift of God, and thou art blind and in darkneſſe that comprehends it not: And the light which doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world, Chriſt Jeſus the gift of God, him by whom the world was made, this light was before any naturall light was made, Sun, Moon, or Stars; for all things that was made, was made by the light, which came a light into the world, that all through him might believe, for he that believes not in the light, is condemned already, and he that does believe in the light hath the witneſſe in himſelfe, to ſet to his ſeale that God is true, and the ſpirit of truth that doth reprove the world is perfect, &amp; of God.</p>
               <p>The light which every one that cometh into the world is enlightned withall, is not conſcience, for the light was before any thing was made, or conſcience named: So the light is that which exerciſeth the conſcience towards God, and towards man, where it is loved, and the voice heard; but where it is hated, and the voice not heard, the conſcience is ſeared, and the light is their condemnation, whoſe conſciences is ſeared, which light was before conſcience was.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This hath been your worke to keep people in ignorance, which you may be aſhamed of. A naturall man cannot worſhip God, for he cannot receive the things of God, nor a ſinfull man, but worſhip the Devill, for he that commits ſin, ſerves him, and he that ſerves ſin, ſerves the devill, and worſhips him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.34. And Chriſt ſaid the Phariſees ſhould receive the greater damnation, for their pretended long prayers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. and ſo he did not juſtifie them in their long prayers, but rebuked them, and ſaid, Wo unto them who draw near with their lips, when their hearts were far off, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13.

And further thou ſayeſt, if they pray as they ſhould not, and yet not ſin, is praying as they ſhould and as they ſhould not, one? by this to call upon God with their lips, and the heart not right, and the prayers and ſacrifice of the wicked is juſtified, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. and if any pray as they ſhould not, are they not condemned for it? and if in praying as they ſhould not, be not ſin, then they do as they ſhould.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle bad him Repent, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.22 and he was ſenſible he had ſinned: and that which makes a man ſenſible of ſin, brings him to pray aright, and turns him from witchcraft, and ſo thou doſt put no difference between the precious and the vile, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.26. the accepted and unaccepted.</p>

And Chriſt called them that took up ſtones to ſtone him, of their Father the Devil, for doing his luſt, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. And thou who would have the people to ſtone, and calls it Chriſtian zeal, thou haſt manifeſted thy Father, and to be of the Devil, who was a Murtherer from the beginning, but you are the Serpents and vipers that would kill to fill the meaſure of your Fathers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.32. and perſecute from City to City, and hale out of the Synagogues, <hi>John</hi> 16.2. that all the righteous blood, ſhed from righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> might come upon you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.35. and you are they that kill the bodies of the Saints, and are ſhedders of the righteous blood, (Mark, the righteous blood) that the righteous blood might be upon you.

So it is about the Sacrifice, and worſhip, ye would murther and ſlay: So ye are in <hi>Cains</hi> way, a company of vagabonds, whoſe Sacrifice God hath no reſpect unto; if we were enemies, you would not teach the people to ſtone us, if ye were Miniſters of Chriſt, but love us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. And do good to us. If the Apoſtles ſhould have taught the people to ſtone all that were contrary to their minde, and Chriſt ſhould have taught his Diſciples to ſtone all that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their minde, and tell them that were Chriſtian zeal; but ye may ſee Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And theſe Presbyterian Prieſts, (are people) petitions the Magiſtrates, with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, they might not be guilty of others blood; which pretence is in their Petitions, to take away their fear, that their wicked p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thoſe Presbyterian Prieſts that ſet up club Law and perſecution againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who would not have any to receive them into their houſes. So this is abominable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, contrary to the Apoſtle, whoſe Doctrine you have troden under your feet, who ſaid, <hi>Be not forgetful to entertain Strangers, for thereby ſome have entertained Angels un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares,</hi> Heb. 13.2.</p>
               <p>And they ſay again, They have no certain dwelling places.

               <p>And you Presbyterian Prieſts with your club Law, who would club thoſe people ſcornfully called Quakers away; you would have an Order from the Juſtices, that none ſhould receive the Quakers into their houſes, and ſtop them of their liberty; and this is contrary to the Law of the Nations: And this is damnable doctrine, wherewith ye poiſon the people, and ſtirs them up with madneſs and folly. And in ſtead of teaching of them peace, you teach them ſtrife, and in ſtead of loving one another, you teach them to fight one with another.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Henry Foreſide</hi> Prieſt cryes ſtone them. And <hi>James Naſmith</hi> Prieſt cryes for club Law. And <hi>William Hambleton</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Glasford</hi> ſaid to <hi>Andrew Brown,</hi> if the Lawes were right, they would chop off all the Quakers heads: by <hi>William Hambletons</hi> words the Law is wrong, becauſe it doth not fulfill his purpoſe and envy.</p>
               <p>Here all may ſee that you are doing the Devils work, hunting after blood, whoſe envy, madneſs and folly appears to all men; what ye cannot do your ſelves, ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the people to do; and what ye and the people cannot do, ye Petition the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to do, that all unrighteous blood may come upon you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.35.</p>

No cry you, chop off their heads, begging by petitions that none may receive them into their houſes, ſtone them, fall upon them by club law, that your folly and madneſs may be made manifeſt; and yet impriſon them, and ſuch as receive them into their houſes: As for inſtance, ye cauſed <hi>Iohn Hart</hi> of the heads of <hi>Glasford</hi> and <hi>Jennet Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleton</hi> widow of <hi>Weſtmanies,</hi> to be impriſoned for entertaining them into their houſes.

               <p>And upon this bargaine that the Magiſtrates would grant them an order, that none ſhould receive them into their houſes, and that they might not have their liberty, and their ſervants would be much refreſhed, who cry ſtone them, let us have a Law againſt them, and if the Laws were right, they would chop off their heads, and make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move by club Law; but how was theſe Prieſts the Magiſtrates ſervants at <hi>Dunbar</hi> Fight, when they excomunicated and curſed their now being army and Magiſtracy? but now they would be their ſervants, if they would execute their wills upon the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: Surely theſe things cannot but ſtink to all Magiſtrates that feare God.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ſervants and ſervers of the times, that the Prophets calls inchanters, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.16. and for their own falſe ends; ye can never read that the Apoſtles nor Chriſt did ever teach any ſuch doctrine that the people ſhould be ſtoned, or have their heads choped off, or driven away by club law, which ſhows you are Apoſtates, from the Apoſtacy, and of the Jewiſh nature.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> in the ſecond moneth, did ordain concerning theſe perſons in <hi>Clidedale,</hi> formerly Excommunicated who are called Quakers, that no other people in other pariſhes ſhould bargain with them, or ſuffer them to come within their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or have enrertainement for money: Upon which the people perſecuted and ſtoned them, and haled them out of their houſes in ſeverall places, <hi>viz.</hi> Three of them people called Quakers, were in the night time between 10. and 11. houres, drawn by force out of an Inne, in the Town of <hi>New-mills</hi> in <hi>Aire-ſhire,</hi> and ſtoned out of the town into the Fields to ſhift for their lodging.

For both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> all were under ſin, and none of them did good, no not one.

               <p>Now if God command all men every where to Repent, and, as thou ſayſt, does not intend they ſhould Repent, thou and you go about to make God unjuſt: Firſt the Lord he deſireth not the death of a ſinner, but that he ſhould turn from his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and live, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.11. Now in the turning from his wickedneſs he lives, but in going on in his wickedneſs he dies; ſo Repentance was Preached from dead works, to ſerve the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. and Chriſt came to call ſinners to Repentance, not the righteous; for the whole needs not the Phyſitian, but the ſick, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12, 13.</p>

                  <hi>George Weare</hi> bad him prove his practice for ſprinkling of Infants, and whether or no they were not to believe before they were Baptized. He ſaid the promiſe was to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed; <hi>George</hi> anſwered him, it was not to ſeeds, as to many, but to thy ſeed which is Chriſt. <hi>Robert</hi> the Prieſt ſaid, That ſeed Chriſt, was natural, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Apoſtles doctrine, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. who ſaid Chriſt was the power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14, 15. and Chriſt the myſtery, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.2.7. The firſt man is of the earth earthly, the ſecond man is the Lord from Heaven heavenly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. the ſpiritual man judgeth all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15.

                  <hi>Pr. The good tidings, which the glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt brings to ſinners, was a great mercy to the Jewes, a very gratious diſpenſation to us ſinners of the Gentiles.</hi>

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:96882:198"/> or Gentiles, and it is a judgement and a condemnation, to all that do not receive it both Jewes and Gentiles. But as for you fifteen Prieſts, you have included your ſelves among the ſinners, ſhewing that you are yet unconverted to the pretious faith, which brings out of all ſin and gives victory over it, and who are converted are changed and renewed from being ſinners, to be righteous, and theſe are not ſinners of the Gentiles, (as is manifeſt you yet are) but they are believers of the Gentiles, who are made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the righteouſneſſe of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who hath quickned them from death to life, and from ſin to God, but upon ſuch that do remaine ſinner of the Gentiles, and receives not the Goſpell which is the power of God, the diſpenſation of it is judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and condemnation, and this ſhall the teſtimony of God in every man give witneſſe to.</p>

               <p>Anſ. The Miniſters of Chriſt Jeſus who were called and ſent of him, were light in the Lord, and were tranſlated from darkneſſe to the light, and from Satans power to God, and the cloud of ſin was not over them, for that was removed, and they were as a City ſet on a hill, and were the light of the world, and their mindes were ſpirituall and inlightned and not over-ſhadowed with the darkneſſe nor with the cloud of ſin, as it is with theſe 15.

But who are come to the fulfilling of the promiſes

               <p>IF any one want Light, let him look upon the Law and the teſtimony whether they ſpeak after this meaning; If he do not this, he ſtumbles and ſuffers hunger, and if he ſuffer hunger, he is not patient, but blaſphemeth his King and his God, then looketh he upward and downward to the earth, and behold there is trouble and darkneſs, vexation is round about him, and the cloud of error, and out of ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity ſhall he not eſcape, even like as in time paſt it hath been ſeen well this is the old Tranſlation, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>New Tranſlation thus. To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them; and they ſhall paſſe through it hardly beſtead and hungry, and it ſhall come to paſſe that when they ſhall be hungry, they ſhall fret themſelves, and curſe their King and their God, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and they ſhall look unto the earth, and behold trouble and darkneſs, and dimneſs of anguiſh, and they ſhall be driven to darkneſs, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20.21, 22.</p>
               <p>Old Tranſlation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. when thou ſitteſt at the Table with a Lord, order thy ſelf mannerly with the things ſet before thee; meaſure thine Appetite, and if thou wilt rule thy own ſelf, be not over greedy of his meat, for meat beguiles and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives.</p>
               <p>New Tranſlation thus: When thou ſitteſt to eat with a Ruler, conſider diligently what is before thee, and put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man given to Appetite; Be not deſirous of his dainties, for they are deceitful meat, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.1, 2 3.</p>
               <p>Old Tranſlation, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. Cry they out Alarum with the Trumpet in the City and the people not affraid? cometh there any plague in a City without it be the Lords doing?</p>
               <p>New Tranſlation thus: ſhall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and the People not be afraid? ſhall there be evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it? <hi>Hoſea</hi> 5.6.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. in the new Tranſlation it is ſaid, who being the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon.</p>
               <p>But in the old Tranſlation it Reads thus: being the brightneſs of his glory, and the very Image of his ſubſtance.</p>
